      "{'DEAN': \" : No, I didn't. . : Well, first of all, I didn't fire anybody this week. We did bring in Roy Neel, and I think he is going to do a great job, former President Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Al Gore's chief of staff. . : Who never lobbied and kept faith with his ethics pledge, I might add. You know, it's interesting here, a lot of talk about my campaign. Everybody on this stage, or a lot of people on this stage, have now embraced my message. They all talk about change. They all talk about bringing people into the party. I stood up against No Child Left Behind. I stood up against No Child Left Behind when nobody else would. So the question is: When you go to elect a president, you want somebody who's going to stand up for you. How do you know anybody else is going to stand up for you if they wouldn't do it when it really counted and when it wasn't popular? . : Well, I don't think anybody knows for sure. And that's why I support the idea of an idea of an independent commission. What we do know is this: The president was not candid with the American people when we went to war. It's why I did not support going to war, even though I did support the first Gulf War and I did support the Afghanistan war. I simply didn't believe what the president was saying. What we now find out is that the Vice President Dick Cheney went to the CIA on at least one occasion, and maybe more, sat with middle-  level CIA operatives and berated them because he didn't like their intelligence reports. It seems to me that the vice president of the United States therefore influenced the very reports that the president then used to decide to go to war and to ask Congress for permission to go to war. I am very, very proud of our military. They have done an outstanding job. I think our military ought to be used when we need to use our military. The president himself and the secretary of state have recently admitted that there was no connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11; that there was no connection and no evidence of connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaida. In that case, why are we in Iraq? And why are so many people from South Carolina there right now, when they should be home concentrating on homeland security and when they should be going after Osama bin Laden and Al Qaida? . : You know, I think in some ways, unfortunately, the terrorists have already won. We have an act that allows American citizens to be held without knowing what they're charged with and without seeing a lawyer. To my knowledge, that hasn't happened since 1798, with the Alien and Sedition Acts. We can't do that, Tom. We can't - -  I think none of us mind being searched and have our shaving kits rummaged through in the airlines and all that. But if we start giving up our fundamental liberties as Americans because terrorists attacked us, then we have a big problem. I honestly don't believe that John Ashcroft and George Bush and the members of the Federalist Society view the Constitution the way mainstream American attorneys or the way most American citizens do. We have a right to protection of our liberties. A lot of people died for that in the Revolutionary War. And I am not going to let the right wing of the Republican Party take those liberties away from us. (APPLAUSE) . : That may be true. Let me tell you what we should do about jobs. We ought to change NAFTA. We've only done half the job with globalization. You've globalized the rights of big corporations to do business anywhere in the country, but what we now need to do is globalize the rights of workers, labor unions, environmentalists and human rights. If you do that, you raise the standard of living in other countries. And what happens is our jobs stop going away because the cost of production goes up. It also reduces illegal immigration, because now you don't have to come to the United States to make a living, you can make one in your country. People don't leave their countries because they hate their country; they leave their countries because they can't make a living. And now we can do that. You've got to put the emphasis on fair trade, not free trade. And what the problem has been that when the Clinton administration and the Bush administration continued to push this, only half the job was done. We forgot about the workers. If you want jobs in this country, here's what you do. First, you've got to balance the budget. Not one Republican president has balanced the budget in 34 years in this country. You cannot trust the right wing with your money. (APPLAUSE) Secondly, you've got to invest in small businesses. Small businesses and self- employed people create 70 percent of all the new jobs in America. That's where our investments should be going, not tax credits to corporations who move their headquarters to Bermuda and their jobs to China. (APPLAUSE) . : No, I think that's right. But I also think that Bill Clinton showed that when you improve the economy and get people jobs, then you increase payroll taxes and you make these funds more solvent. Now, Senator Kerry is the front- runner, and I mean him no insult, but in 19 years in the Senate, Senator Kerry sponsored nine - -  11 bills that had anything to do with health care, and not one of them passed. If you want a president who is going to get results, I suggest that you look at somebody who did get results in my state. That's how we're going to fix Medicare, is to get somebody who has executive experience in governing, particularly in health care, particularly somebody who is a doctor who understands these things, who is willing to get stuff done. And I don't think we are going to do that getting somebody from the United States Senate to be the Democratic nominee. (APPLAUSE) . : Actually, in urban states, the NRA doesn't have a very reputation, but in rural states like mine, it does. I've done a lot of conservation work with the NRA. But I want to take a run at Senator Kerry and give him another rebuttal opportunity here, because he gave what I consider to be a real Washington answer to the last question about mental health. He claimed credit for the mental health parity bill and for helping children get health care. Well, in South Carolina there is 102,000 kids with no health care. Do you have mental health parity? Because if you were in my state, you would. And I don't think what Senator Kerry was talking about has been very much help for the people of South Carolina or anyplace else. With me, you'll get results, because I'm a governor and I've done it. And with Washington, no matter what they say, it never seems to trickle down to the people in South Carolina. .\", 'CLARK': ' : Well, I think we are going to win some of these states. We\\'re very strong across this country. We\\'re running a national campaign. But, Tom, I want to make very clear that I\\'m not a career politician, I\\'m not a Washington insider. I am an outsider. And I\\'m running this race as someone who\\'s spent his life in leadership and public service in this country. Not someone who\\'s part of the problem, I\\'ll be the solution to the problem. If the American people like what\\'s going in Washington, then they should vote for people who\\'ve been there and been part of the Washington scene - -  No Child Left Behind and all the rest. I haven\\'t been. . : Tom, I\\'ll tell you what I think we should do with Iraq right now. We\\'re going to have to form an international organization to take the burden off the United States. The president is playing politics with national security when he says we\\'ll be out by the 30th of June. That\\'s just an arbitrary date related to the presidential election. It\\'s not related to what\\'s going on on the ground. We need an international organization. We need to be able to bring every nation in that wants to help. We need to pull Bremer out. We need to put the U. S. forces there underneath NATO. But I want to go back to the question you raised a minute ago about Iraq, because I heard from the Pentagon two weeks after 9/11 that the administration was determined to go into Iraq, whether or not there was any connection with 9/11; that they were going to use it as a pretext for invading Iraq. And that was common knowledge in Washington. There should never have been a congressional authorization for the president to have a blank check to take this country to war, because everybody knew that\\'s what he intended to do. And they knew what the timetable was. It was a politically motivated timetable to go in the 30th of March, just like this 30th of June date. We\\'ve got to change this government. (APPLAUSE) . : No, no, no, Tom, no, I didn\\'t blame the Bush administration for the attacks. We know who did the attacks. It was Osama bin Laden and Al Qaida. But what I have said is that the president did not do all he could have done to have prevented that attack. . : Well, I have not been on the inside of the Clinton administration, in terms of how they responded to terror. . : I will tell you this, Tom. Here\\'s what we did. We always recognized that there was a threat of terrorism. And we began in 1996, with Khobar Towers, to really work on the defensive, the anti- terrorism measures. And as the commander in Europe, we really strengthened our security. And that was my focus, the security of the military forces over there. In \\'98, when Osama bin Laden issued a fatwa against the United States, there should have been, at that point, measures to go and get Osama bin Laden. I\\'m told that there were such measures that were attempted to be undertaken. Why they didn\\'t work, what they are, and so forth, I don\\'t know. But I will say this: that when the Bush administration came to office, the Bush administration was told the greatest threat to America is Osama bin Laden, and yet almost nine months later, when the United States was struck, there was still no plan as to what to do with Osama bin Laden. But we had worked really hard with Vladimir Putin to do something about national missile defense and get out of the ABM Treaty, and a lot of other things had been done. This administration did not have its priorities right, and the president, not the intelligence community, and not the previous administration, President George W. Bush must be held accountable for that. That\\'s the job of the president of the United States: to focus attention, to set the priorities, to take the actions to keep America safe. (APPLAUSE) . : Well, I would start all over with a lot of things this administration has done, Tom. . : And let me start at the. . . (APPLAUSE) Just to get into this. What we\\'ve got is a runaway deficit in the United States of America right now. And what we need to do is take back to the federal government the resources we need. This prescription drug benefit is an important benefit, if it\\'s done right, for our seniors. But to do it right, you\\'ve got to bargain competitively with the pharmaceutical companies and lower the prices. You\\'ve got to stop giving a handout to the HMOs. You\\'ve got to take Medicare out of competition with the HMOs. And you\\'ve got to close the donut hole. I think with the right leadership in Washington, we can fix this Medicare prescription benefit for our seniors. It\\'s just about leadership. And that\\'s what this president doesn\\'t show in Washington on our economy. . : And my plan is a three- part plan. First of all, we\\'re going to insure all children. That will be mandated, and we\\'ll help the parents if they can\\'t afford it. Secondly, we\\'re going to get all adults access to insurance, and we\\'re going to help low-  and moderate- income families to buy that insurance, so they\\'re not dependent. And third, we\\'re going to really do cost containment - -  not only the provision that John Edwards is talking about, but other provisions. We\\'re going to have a health standards commission that\\'s going to look at the evidence that comes in from the results of medical procedures. We\\'re going to be able to provide guidelines for physicians so they do have protection against the malpractice suits and against needless tests. We\\'re going to work to automate or use information technology, so that we can control and reduce the 98,000 needless deaths every year in hospitals. So what we want to do is take the existing system, make it better, pull people under it. And then we\\'ll see where that goes. But build on what we have. Don\\'t try to replace it with something else. . : Tom, I grew up in the South and I went to church every Sunday and I did all that and I can quote Scriptures and so forth. But, you know, I think that we need to preserve the separation of church and state. (APPLAUSE) I think that kids in school should have the opportunity to pray voluntarily. But when I was a kid in school in Little Rock, we read the Bible and we prayed in home room every morning. And it never occurred to me that I had Jewish friends sitting right there. Now I think, \"What must they have thought? \" I think we have to be sensitive to other people in this country, and that\\'s why we need to protect the separation of church and state. .', 'KUCINICH': ' : Well, Tom, keep in mind, there\\'s so much talent on this stage that I believe this race is going to go all the way to the convention. And what that means - -  no one\\'s going to get 50 percent of the delegates going to the convention. And I expect to be able to pick up delegates, state by state. And I\\'ll arrive at the convention right in the mix for the nomination, and I look forward to it. . : Tom, you\\'ve mischaracterized my position. . : My position is that we go to the United Nations with a whole new direction, where the United States gives up control of the oil, control of the contracts, control of ambitions to privatize Iraq, gives up to the United Nations all that on an interim basis to be handled on behalf of the Iraqi people until the Iraqi people are self-  governing. Furthermore, we would ask that the U. N. handle the elections and the construction of a constitution for the Iraqi people. When the U. N. agrees with that, at that point, we ask U. N. peacekeepers to come in and rotate our troops out. We help to fund it, we would help pay to rebuild Iraq, and we would give reparations to those innocent civilian noncombatants who lost their lives - -  to their families. . : On an interim basis, until the Iraqi people can be self- governing. . : I wouldn\\'t say it wasn\\'t on the agenda. I would say that the Clinton administration handled its approach in a way that I think tried to create international cooperation. Tom, where I think the problem is today is that the administration\\'s approach, their doctrine is wrong. The doctrine of preemption led us into Iraq. The doctrine of unilateralism essentially led us into Iraq. The doctrine of first strike puts us at risk of expanding war. So this administration started off with the wrong doctrine. And you know what? It was ideologically driven. Because we know that the Project for the New American Century was talking years before about an attack on Iraq and their ideological adherents came into the administration. We need to re- engage with the world community and work with the world community through the U. N. Tom, that\\'s the only way we\\'re going to be safe as a nation. (APPLAUSE) . : Well, that presumes that people of this country do not have a social consciousness. I believe they do. That\\'s why we\\'ve lost hundreds of textile plants in this country. That\\'s why our steel, automotive, aerospace, shipping and textile industries are in such severe trouble. What I intend to do as president of the United States is to challenge this global trading structure where corporations are actually controlling nations with their trade rules. That\\'s why I\\'ve said my first act in office will be to cancel NAFTA and the WTO. . . (APPLAUSE) . . . and return to bilateral trade, which will be conditioned on workers\\' rights, human rights and environmental quality principles. Tom, with all respect to Governor Dean, you can\\'t just say you\\'re going to fix these trade agreements, because they\\'re written so as not to be fixed. They could have been fixed in 1993 when NAFTA was passed, and in \\'94 when the WTO went into effect. We are losing our manufacturing base. Some of these trade laws, you can\\'t even buy America the way they\\'re set up. And so, you know, my position: Buy America or bye- bye America. (APPLAUSE) . : I actually introduced the bill to create that. . : No. Because what Senator Clinton was proposing was really more HMOs, and the competition in the insurance industry caused so many people in the insurance industry to be afraid of it. Let me tell you what the real issue is here. America spends $1. 6 trillion on health care. But all that money doesn\\'t go for the care of people. About $400 billion goes for the activities of the for- profit system. There are people who are stuck, who have insurance, who have higher premiums, co- pays and deductibles regularly. They\\'re asking, \"Who\\'s going to take care of me? \" My proposal shifts the whole system into a not- for- profit system. It eliminates these corporate profits and stock options and executive salaries, the advertising, lobbying, marketing costs. And you know what it does? It helps. . . (APPLAUSE) Tom, what it does is, it creates a system where everybody is cared for, where all medically necessary procedures are covered, plus vision care, plus dental care, plus mental health care, plus long- term care, plus a prescription drug benefit. That\\'s what I offer. They can state what they offer. (APPLAUSE) .', 'SHARPTON': ' : Well, first of all, I think this is beyond politics. This is about the direction of the party. I fully expect to win primaries in the coming weeks. But I\\'m going to win because I\\'m speaking the issues and interests of people that have been ignoring. It\\'s almost contradictory to say, \"If you don\\'t win, get out. \" Did you come in to win, or did you come in to stand up for something - -  and make that win? And I think that that\\'s what\\'s wrong. We have become too cheap. We act like we\\'re at a race track betting on horses, rather than dealing with the fact that 75,000 lost their jobs in South Carolina. And there are people that I can bring into the process that won\\'t come in if someone like me is not in the process. They ought to want all of us to stay in and bring our constituency to the table rather than try to eliminate. I\\'ve been inspired in this campaign hearing John Edwards talk about he\\'s a son of a mill worker. Well, I\\'m the son of a man who couldn\\'t be a mill worker because of the color of his skin. But his son can be the president of the United States. . : I think that we cannot go quickly past the president giving the wrong premise to the American public to get support. Had he said, \"We\\'re going to war because Saddam Hussein is a bad guy,\" the public would not have rallied around that. We were told, in the wake of 9/11, we were in imminent danger with weapons of mass destruction. We cannot allow him to change this now and say we were just after Hussein because he was a bad guy. Everybody knows Hussein was a bad guy, and there are other bad guys who we didn\\'t go after, and we didn\\'t lie about it. I preached the funeral of a young man, Darius Jennings, who died shot down in a helicopter in Iraq. I preached it right here in Orangeburg, South Carolina. His mother was told he went to war to protect us from weapons of mass destruction. She was not told he went to war because we have a bad guy over there, because there\\'s any number of bad guys. We should find a way to get rid of bad guys, but lying to the American people is not the way you run a country, and George Bush ought to be removed for that. (APPLAUSE) . : Well, first of all, I assume when you say \"the Nation of Islam\" you\\'re talking about Islamic nations, because there is a Nation of Islam in the United States that has nothing to do what you\\'re talking about. (LAUGHTER) So I\\'m just asking for clarity. (APPLAUSE) . : You\\'re talking about Islamic - -  first of all, I think. . . . : But, in many ways, I think that we can\\'t allow the distortion, because Mr. Bush and some of his crowd have said they represent a Christian view against the Islamic. And I don\\'t think Christ could join most of their churches. (LAUGHTER) So, I mean, I don\\'t agree with the speech. (APPLAUSE) . : I think that they called themselves supporters of the Bush administration. . : Not the president himself. . : But many of their supporters talk about how they represent Christianity. I don\\'t think they represent Christianity any more than some of these murderers, and mass murderers, represent Islam. So let\\'s not blame the religion. Let\\'s blame those that use religion to do some ruthless, deadly, wicked acts. Now, having said that. . . (APPLAUSE) Having said that, I think we should build relationships with those nations around the world, and I have visited them. And how do you build relationships? Work with them on things of self- interest. Many of them need clean water supplies, clean sanitation, trade. They would become our partners if we engaged in partnership. But I don\\'t that the way we do that is attacking people\\'s religion, trying to act like our religion is better. And as far as Mr. Bush saying that he doesn\\'t need a permission slip from the U. N. , he doesn\\'t think he needs votes from the American people to be president. . : I think they should pay their share, which is more. I think that when you have the present set- up that you have and you go above $80,000 and they pay nothing, I think that is absolutely ridiculous. I think that they must pay their share. And, you know, it\\'s absurd to me for people to come and look at the people in South Carolina in the face and say, \"It\\'s an honor for your sons and daughters to go abroad and die for others. But it is a burden for rich people to pay their tax at home. \" I mean, you can\\'t have it both ways. Either all of us. . . (APPLAUSE) . . . should be honored to sacrifice or none of us should. In terms of jobs, I want to address that. We need to create jobs. Not only do we need to rescind NAFTA - -  and I think we must rescind it. You can\\'t correct it. It has cost jobs. It has sent jobs from this state to Asia and other places. This president has increased the deficit, has not increased jobs and is embracing the rich at the expense of working class and poor people. And it\\'s double in communities of color. Black unemployment in this state is double. We face class and race. I don\\'t think we can tolerate that four more years. . : Well, first of all, I happen to advocate and have for a long time, single- payer plan. So I do agree with Congressman Kucinich on that. . : I think that the only solution - -  if we can do it in Canada and other places - -  is to move the nation toward that. I also think that the plans of my colleagues here - -  some are more complex than others - -  they\\'re a step in the direction, but I don\\'t think it gets us there. What gets us there is to have a single-  payer plan. I also think we must have the courage and audacity to take on the pharmaceutical industry and those in the medical business. They are being allowed, through deregulation, to do whatever they want. I have more experience than anyone on this stage with fighting for corporate accountability. That\\'s what we did for decades in the civil rights movement. So I think that it is clear that if you want someone that will go to the convention and fight to let us hold accountability over the private sector and fight for a single- payer plan, then Al Sharpton is your candidate. And I don\\'t think this is about getting down South and taking just shots at each other. Because we\\'re in debate, we\\'re going to do that. But people are suffering. People are literally choosing one month to buy prescription drugs, pay their rent the next month. They want answers. They don\\'t want our best shot at each other. (APPLAUSE) . : No. The flag represents a thought, a philosophy and a political movement built on racism, slavery and rape. You can\\'t redo the flag and what it stands for. And I think that we cannot rest until that flag is down everywhere in this country. . : It is a shame that you will take young men and young women from South Carolina, send them abroad, they die under one American flag, they have to come home and live under two flags. You don\\'t send Confederate flags with us to Iraq. Don\\'t wave them in Greenville, don\\'t wave them in Columbia. (APPLAUSE) While we\\'re on that, we right in this county still can\\'t get an official celebration of Martin Luther King\\'s birthday. (APPLAUSE) There\\'s a lot of things that we need to correct, and we need to correct them in 2004. .', 'KERRY': ' Senator Kerry. Homeland Security Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight, and that is: Will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up? Senator John F. Kerry. Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us. And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We\\'re proud to be here. Mr. President, I\\'m glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people. Will we ever be safe and secure again? Yes, we absolutely must be. That\\'s the goal. Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. I believe that this President, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away, and as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. The measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this President had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America, containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of themâ€”95 percent come in today uninspected. That\\'s not good enough. People who fly on airplanes todayâ€”the cargo hold is not X- rayed, but the baggage is. That\\'s not good enough. Firehouses don\\'t have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the President decided to cut the COPS program. So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we go after the terrorists. I will hunt them down, and we\\'ll kill them. We\\'ll capture them. We\\'ll do what\\'s ever necessary to be safe. But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence, and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure. . Senator Kerry. Yes. When the President had an opportunity to capture or kill Usama bin Laden, he took his focus off of him, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Usama bin Laden escaped. Six months after he said, \"Usama bin Laden must be caught, dead or alive,\" this President was asked, \"Where is Usama bin Laden? \" He said, \"I don\\'t know. I don\\'t really think about him very much. I\\'m not that concerned. \" We need a President who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. This really underscores the problem with the American health care system. It\\'s not working for the American family, and it\\'s gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You got about a million right here in Arizonaâ€”just shy, 950,000â€”who have no health insurance at all. Eighty- two thousand Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush\\'s watch. Two hundred and twenty- three thousand kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all. All across our countryâ€”go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance; 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under . Senator Kerry. Actually, it\\'s not an empty promise. It\\'s really interesting because the President used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, \"If it\\'s good enough for the Congressmen and Senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice. \" What we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other Senators, other Congressman choose other programs. But the fact is we\\'re going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We\\'re not giving this away for nothing. Paying for New Federal Spending/Taxes . Senator Kerry. I\\'ll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go. During the 1990s, we had pay- as- you- go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you were going to pay for it and how. President Bush has takenâ€”he\\'s the only President in history to do this. He\\'s also the only President sinceâ€”in 72 years to lose jobs, 1. 6 million jobs lost. He\\'s the only President to have incomes of families go down for the last 3 years, the only President to see exports go down, the only President to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. Now, I\\'m going to reverse that. I\\'m going to change that. We\\'re going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s. Every plan that I have laid out, my health care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans, I\\'ve shown exactly how I\\'m going to pay for those. And we startâ€”we don\\'t do it exclusively, but we start by rolling back George Bush\\'s unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain/Kerry commission, which identified some $60 billion that we can get. We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days, $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and to people importing ceiling fans from China. I\\'m going to stand up and fight for the American worker, and I\\'m going to do it in a way that\\'s fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks. This President has never once vetoed one bill, the first President in 100 years not to do that. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. I want you to notice how the President switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally. Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the President said about fiscal responsibility. Being lectured by the President on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. [Laughter] This President has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent. Tuitions have gone up 35 percent, gasoline prices up 30 percent. Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago. Prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we\\'re losing, and the President just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he\\'s cut job training money. A billion dollars was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it\\'s an election year. They\\'ve cut the Pell grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. They\\'ve cut the training money. They\\'ve wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. I\\'m going to do those things because that\\'s what right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect. Outsourcing Jobs . Senator Kerry. I don\\'t blame them entirely for it. I blame the President for the things the President could do that has an impact on it. Outsourcing is going to happen. I\\'ve acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I\\'ve had shop stewards stand up and say, \"Will you promise me you\\'re going to stop all this outsourcing? \" And I\\'ve looked them in the eye and I\\'ve said, \"No, I can\\'t do that. \" What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system, that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job. Today, if you\\'re an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. So if you\\'re looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, \"Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. \" That\\'s not smart. I don\\'t want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I\\'m President, we\\'re going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond, and we\\'re going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations 5 percent. And we\\'re going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This President didn\\'t stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules with subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I\\'ve been talking about it for months. The fact is that the President had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told, \"Don\\'t even bother. We\\'re not going to listen to it. \" The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven\\'t stood up and fought for. I\\'m going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That\\'s what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact. Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we\\'ll do a lot better. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. Bob, anybody can play with these votes; everybody knows that. I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small- business tax cuts. But you know why the Pell grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualified for them, because they don\\'t have money. But they\\'re not getting the $5,100 the President promised them. They\\'re getting less money. There are more people who qualify. That\\'s not what we want. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. We\\'re all God\\'s children, Bob, and I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney\\'s daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she\\'s being who she was. She\\'s being who she was born as. I think if you talk to anybody, it\\'s not choice. I\\'ve met people who\\'ve struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. And I\\'ve met wives who are supportive of their husbands, or vice versa, when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them. I think we have to respect that. The President and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we\\'re a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can\\'t discriminate in the workplace. You can\\'t discriminate in the rights that you afford people. You can\\'t disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I\\'m for partnership rights and so forth. Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the States have always been able to manage those laws, and they\\'re proving today, every State, that they can manage them adequately. Abortion . Senator Kerry. I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic, and I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many. I believe that I can\\'t legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn\\'t share that article of faith. I believe that choice is a woman\\'s choice. It\\'s between a woman, God, and her doctor, and that\\'s why I support that. Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade. The President has never said whether or not he would do that, but we know from the people he\\'s tried to appoint to the court, he wants to. I will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade. Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life, this has made a difference to me. And as President Kennedy said when he ran for President, he said, \"I\\'m not running to be a Catholic President. I\\'m running to be a President who happens to be Catholic. \" Now, my faith affects everything that I do and choose. There\\'s a great passage of the Bible that says, \"What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith, if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. \" And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people. That\\'s why I fight against poverty. That\\'s why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this Earth. That\\'s why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith. But I know this, that President Kennedy, in his Inaugural Address, told all of us that, \"Here on Earth, God\\'s work must truly be our own. \" And that\\'s what we have toâ€”so I think that\\'s the test of public service. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. The reason health care costs are getting higherâ€”one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of commonsense efforts that would have reduced the costs. Let me give you a prime example. In the Senate, we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the President and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don\\'t have that right. The President blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare. Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors who areâ€” many of themâ€”on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the President made it illegalâ€”illegalâ€”for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. That\\'s a large part of your 17- percent increase in Medicare premiums. When I\\'m President, I\\'m sending that back to Congress, and we\\'re going to get a real prescription drug benefit. Now, we also have people sicker because they don\\'t have health insurance. So whether it\\'s diabetes or cancer, they come to the hospitals later, and it costs America more. We\\'ve got to have health care for all Americans. . Senator Kerry. Once again, the President is misleading America. I\\'ve actually passed 56 individual bills that I\\'ve personally written. And in addition to that, they\\'re not always under my name; there is amendments on certain bills. But more importantly, with respect to the question of \"no record,\" I helped writeâ€”I did writeâ€”I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. And I\\'m very proud of that. So the President\\'s wrong. Senator\\'s Health Care Plan . Senator Kerry. That\\'s correct. . Senator Kerry. Well, two leading national news networks have both said the President\\'s characterization of my health care plan is incorrect. One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I don\\'t force you to do anything. It\\'s not a Government plan. The Government doesn\\'t require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you don\\'t want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don\\'t have to. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co- pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan, and I don\\'t think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Here\\'s what I do. We take over Medicaid children from the States so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the States want toâ€”they\\'re not forced to; they can choose toâ€”they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. It\\'s their choice. I think they\\'ll choose it, because it\\'s a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow youâ€”if you choose to; you don\\'t have toâ€”but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that Senators and Congressmen give themselves. If it\\'s good enough for us, it\\'s good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, DC. If you want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, we\\'re going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50- percent tax credit so that after we lower the cost of health care, they also get, whether they\\'re self- employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is, when you begin to get people covered like thatâ€”for instance, in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works, and I\\'m going to offer it to America. . Senator Kerry. The President just said that Government- run health care results in poor quality. Now, maybe that explains why he hasn\\'t fully funded the VA, and the VA hospital is having trouble, and veterans are complaining. Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicareâ€”he doesn\\'t adequately fund it. But let me just say to America, I am not proposing a Government- run program. That\\'s not what I have. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Senators and Congressmen have a wide choice. Americans ought to have it too. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. You just heard the President say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts. Now, my fellow Americans, that\\'s an invitation to disaster. The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the President\\'s plan, there will be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today\\'s workers pay into the system for today\\'s retirees. And the CBO saidâ€”that\\'s the Congressional Budget Office; it\\'s bipartisanâ€”they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 to 40 percent. Now, the President has never explained to Americaâ€”ever; hasn\\'t done it tonightâ€” where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from? He\\'s already got $3 trillion, according to the Washington Post, of expenses that he\\'s put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid forâ€” not one of them are paid for. The fact is that the President is driving the largest deficits in American history. He\\'s broken the pay- as- you- go rules. I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. In 1985, I was one of the first Democratsâ€” broke with my partyâ€”we balanced the budget in the nineties. We paid down the debt for 2 years. And that\\'s what we\\'re going to do. We\\'re going to protect Social Security. I will not privatize it. I will not cut the benefits. And we\\'re going to be fiscally responsible, and we will take care of Social Security. . Senator Kerry. Not at all. Absolutely not, Bob. This is the same thing we heardâ€” I remember I appeared on \"Meet the Press\" with Tim Russert in 1990- somethingâ€”we heard the same thing. We fixed it. In fact, we put together a $5. 6 trillion surplus in the nineties that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. If you take the tax cut that the President of the United States has givenâ€”President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America, just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075. The President decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the President\\'s tax cut. I don\\'t. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year. And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I\\'ve talked about to move our economy, we\\'re going to grow sufficiently that we begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. Now, we can do that. Now, if later on, after a period of time, we find that Social Security is in trouble, then we\\'ll pull together the top experts of the country. We\\'ll do exactly what we did in the 1990s, and we\\'ll make whatever adjustment is necessary. But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America. The jobs the President is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we\\'re losing. And this is the first President in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobsâ€”1. 6 million jobs. Eleven other Presidentsâ€”six Democrats and five Republicansâ€”had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties. None of them lost jobs the way this President has. I have a plan to put America back to work. And if we\\'re fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we\\'re going to fix Social Security. . Senator Kerry. Let me just answer one part of that last question quickly, and then I\\'ll come to immigration. The American middle- class family isn\\'t making it right now, Bob, and what the President said about the tax cuts have been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs. The fact is the take- home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it\\'s been since 1929. And the take- home pay of the richest 1 percent of Americans is the highest it\\'s been since 1928. Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up, and the wealthiest tax burden has gone down. Now, that\\'s wrong. Now, with respect to immigration reform, the President broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later, he\\'s now promising another plan. Here\\'s what I\\'ll do. Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. The fact is we haven\\'t done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. Secondly, we need a guest- worker program, but if it\\'s all we have, it\\'s not going to solve the problem. The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. It\\'s against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly. And thirdly, we need an earned legalization program for people who\\'ve been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American. We\\'ve got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows. . Senator Kerry. Four thousand people a day are coming across the border. The fact is that we now have people from the Middle Eastâ€”allegedlyâ€”coming across the border. And we\\'re not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology. We have iris identification technology. We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today. We can know who the people are, that they\\'re really the people they say they are, when they cross the border. We could speed it up. There are huge delays. The fact is, our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I\\'ll make them secure. Minimum Wage/Education/Jobs . Senator Kerry. The gap between rich and poor is growing wider. More people are dropping into poverty. Yet the minimum wage has been stuck at, what, $5. 15 an hour now for about 7 years. Is it time to raise it? . Senator Kerry. Well, I\\'m glad you raised that question. It\\'s long- overdue time to raise the minimum wage. And America, this is one of those issues that separates the President and myself. We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won\\'t even let us have a vote on it. We\\'re not allowed to vote on it. They don\\'t want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our Nation in 50 years. If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. The President has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn\\'t hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut. But people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kidsâ€”family values that we\\'re supposed to value so much in Americaâ€”I\\'m tired of politicians who talk about family values and don\\'t value families. What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold onto equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That\\'s not right in America. And we have an initiative that we were working on to raise women\\'s pay. They\\'ve cut it off. They\\'ve stopped it. They don\\'t enforce these kinds of things. I think that it is a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. We\\'d put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American Dream. And if we did that, we\\'d have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage. . Senator Kerry. Is that a new question, or a 30- second question? . Senator Kerry. Which time limit are weâ€”â€” . Senator Kerry. Thank you very much. Well, again, the President didn\\'t answer the question. I will answer it straight to America. I\\'m not going to appoint a judge to the court who is going to undo a constitutional right, whether it\\'s the first amendment or the fifth amendment or some other right that\\'s given under our courts todayâ€” under the Constitution. And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right. So, I don\\'t intend to see it undone. Clearly, the President wants to leave an ambivalence or intends to undo it. Let me go a step further. We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America. I don\\'t know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children, of black children in some cities dropping out of high school. And yet the President, who talks about No Child Left Behind, refused to fully fundâ€”by $28 billionâ€”that particular program, so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people. Now, right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the State of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The President reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind. He will tell you he\\'s raised the money, and he has, but he didn\\'t put in what he promised. And that makes a difference in the lives of our children. . Senator Kerry. You don\\'t measure it by a percentage increase. Mr. President, you measure it by whether you\\'re getting the job done. Five hundred thousand kids lost after- school programs because of your budget. Now, that\\'s not in my gut. That\\'s not my value systemâ€”and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut: $89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after- school programs. You be the judge. Addressing the Needs of the Military . Senator Kerry. You have 2 minutes, sir. Senator, at the last debate, President Bush said he did not favor a draft. You agreed with him. But our National Guard and Reserve forces are being severely strained because many of them are being held beyond their enlistments. Some of them say that it\\'s a back- door draft. Is there any relief that could be offered to these brave Americans and their families? If you became President, Senator Kerry, what would you do about this situation of holding National Guard and Reservists for these extended periods of time and these repeated callups that they\\'re now facing? . Senator Kerry. Well, I think the fact that they\\'re facing these repeated callups, some of them two and three deployments, and there\\'s a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this President exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. Our military is overextended. Nine out of ten Active Duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq, or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, they\\'re wrapped up in it. Now, I\\'ve proposed adding two active- duty divisions to the Armed Forces of the United States, one combat, one support. In addition, I\\'m going to double the number of special forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. There\\'s much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that, and that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of our Armed Forces is, frankly, to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. I\\'ve said it before; I say it again: I believe the President broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this Nation to war. He said he would work through theâ€”a real alliance. He said in Cincinnati, \"We would plan carefully. We would take every precaution. \" Well, we didn\\'t, and the result is our forces today are overextended. The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last resort. And America now is paying already 120 billion, up to 200 billion before we\\'re finished and much more, probably, and that is the result of this President taking his eye off of Usama bin Laden. . Senator Kerry. I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation. In fact, I\\'ve said the opposite. I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation. No nation will ever have a veto over us. But I think it makes senseâ€”I think most Americans in their guts know that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard. That\\'s how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that\\'s how you gain legitimacy in the world. But I will never fail to protect the United States of America. . Senator Kerry. I believe it was a failure of Presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban. I am a hunter. I\\'m a gun owner. I\\'ve been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old. And I respect the second amendment, and I will not tamper with the second amendment. But I\\'ll tell you this. I\\'m also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorney offices in America, one of the 10 largest. I\\'ve put people behind bars for the rest of their life. I\\'ve broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They don\\'t want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK- 47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with the sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us and said, \"See that house over there? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK- 47 lying on the bed right beside him. \" Because of the President\\'s decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. And that\\'s what Usama bin Laden\\'s handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan, and it encouraged them to do it. So I believe America is less safe. If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, \"Sorry, we don\\'t have the votes,\" I\\'d have said, \"Then we\\'re going to have a fight. \" And I\\'d have taken it out to the country, and I\\'d have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those Congressmen. We\\'d have won what Bill Clinton won. Affirmative Action . Senator Kerry. No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along. And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along. I\\'ll give you an example. I\\'m theâ€”I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once; now I\\'m the senior Democrat on it. We used toâ€”we have a goal there for minority set- aside programs to try to encourage ownership in the country. They don\\'t reach those goals. They don\\'t even fight to reach those goals. They\\'ve tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination, and affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women. It\\'s with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at what\\'s happened, we\\'ve made progress; I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called \"mend it, don\\'t end it. \" We fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason, because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism. And so we have a distance to travel. As President, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This President is the first President ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a President who hasn\\'t met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a President who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. If a President doesn\\'t reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as President, and I\\'ll make my best effort to do it. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. Well, I respect everything that the President has said, and certainly I respect his faith. I think it\\'s important, and I share it. I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty. Everything is a gift from the Almighty. And as I measure the words of the Bibleâ€”and we all do; different people measure different things, the Koran, the Torah, orâ€” Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being, and people all find their ways to express it. I was taughtâ€”I went to a church school, and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are \"Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body, and your soul\" and \"Love your neighbor as yourself. \" And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. There\\'s one for the people who have, and there\\'s one for the people who don\\'t have. And we\\'re struggling with that today. The President and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith. I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead. I think we\\'ve got a lot more work to do. And as President, I will always respect everybody\\'s right to practice religion as they choose or not to practice, because that\\'s part of America. Era of Divisiveness . Senator Kerry. Well, very much so. Let me pay a compliment to the President, if I may. I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the President did a terrific job. And I really was moved as well as impressed by the speech that he gave to the Congress. And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans; we were all just Americans. That\\'s where we were. That\\'s not where we are today. I regret to say that the President, who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. I\\'ve never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. I\\'ve never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they\\'re locked out today. We have to change that, and as President, I am committed to changing that. I don\\'t care if the idea comes from the other side or this side. I think we have to come together and work to change it. And I\\'ve done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I\\'ve worked with John McCain, who\\'s sitting here. I\\'ve worked with other colleagues. I\\'ve reached across the aisle. I\\'ve tried to find the common ground, because that\\'s what makes us strong as Americans. And if Americans trust me with the Presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effortâ€”openly, not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside, but a genuine effort to try to restore America\\'s hope and possibilities by bringing people together. And one of the ways we\\'re going to do it is, I\\'m going to work with my friend John McCain to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people so America is really represented by the people who make up America. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. Well, I guess the President and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up. [Laughter] And some would say maybe me more so than others. [Laughter] But I can take it. [Laughter] Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn\\'t ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run. And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing. And she looked at me from her hospital bed, and she just looked at me, and she said, \"Remember, integrity, integrity, integrity. \" Those are the three words that she left me with. And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what\\'s right, what\\'s wrong. They also kick me around. [Laughter] They keep me honest. They don\\'t let me get away with anything. I can sometimes take myself too seriously. They surely don\\'t let me do that. And I\\'m blessed, as I think the President is blessed. As I said last time, I\\'ve watched him with the First Lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughtersâ€”he\\'s a great father. And I think we\\'re both very lucky. Closing Statements . Senator Kerry. My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division. More than ever, we need to be united as a country. And like Franklin Roosevelt, I don\\'t care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether it\\'s going to make us stronger. These are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of a troubled world. And I believe that we can, together, do things that are within the grasp of Americans. We can lift our schools up. We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we\\'re losing overseas. We can have health care for all Americans. We can further the cause of equality in our Nation. Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this Nation that I love. And with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. I believe we can do better. I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. And I ask you to embark on that journey with me. I ask you for your trust. I ask you for your help. I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great Nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever. Thank you. Good night, and God bless the United States of America. . Senator Kerry. Well, that brings these debates to a close, but the campaign goes on. I want to wish both of you the very best of luck between now and election day. That\\'s it for us from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. I\\'m Bob Schieffer of CBS News. Good night, everyone. NOTE: The debate began at 6 p. m. in Gammage Auditorium at Arizona State University. In his remarks, the President referred to former President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Senator Kerry referred to Usama bin Laden, leader of the Al Qaida terrorist organization. rntCitation:\\xa0George W. Bush: \"Presidential Debate in Tempe, Arizona,\" October 13, 2004.

Gentlemen, to the business at hand. The first question is for Senator Kerry, and it will come from Cheryl Otis, who is right behind me. Consistent Leadership Cheryl Otis. Senator Kerry, after talking to several coworkers and family and friends, I asked the ones who said they were not voting for you, why. They said that you were too wishy- washy. Do you have a reply for them? Senator John F. Kerry. Yes, I certainly do. [Laughter] But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating. I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening. Mr. President, it\\'s good to be with you again this evening, sir. Cheryl, the President didn\\'t find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he\\'s really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. And the result is that you\\'ve been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I\\'ve changed a position on this or that or the other. Now, the three things they try to say I\\'ve changed position on are the PATRIOT Actâ€”I haven\\'t. I support it. I just don\\'t like the way John Ashcroft has applied it. And we\\'re going to change a few things. The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things. No Child Left Behind Actâ€”I voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the President has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, you\\'ve laid off 350 teachers. You\\'re 150â€”excuse me, I think it\\'s a little moreâ€”about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here. So I complain about that. I\\'ve argued that we should fully fund it. The President says I\\'ve changed my mind. I haven\\'t changed my mind. I\\'m going to fully fund it. So these are the differences. Now, the President has presided over the economy where we\\'ve lost 1. 6 million jobs, the first President in 72 years to lose jobs. I have a plan to put people back to work. That\\'s not wishy- washy. I\\'m going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas. The President wants to keep them open. I think I\\'m right. I think he\\'s wrong. I\\'m going to give you a tax cut. The President gaveâ€”the top one percent of income earners in America got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together. I think that\\'s wrong. That\\'s not wishy- washy, and that\\'s what I\\'m fighting forâ€”you. . Senator Kerry. Robin, I\\'m going to answer your question. I\\'m also going to talkâ€” respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time. The world is more dangerous today. The world is more dangerous today because the President didn\\'t make the right judgments. Now, the President wishes that I had changed my mind. He wants you to believe that, because he can\\'t come here and tell you that he\\'s created new jobs for America. He\\'s lost jobs. He can\\'t come here and tell you that he\\'s created health care for Americans because one- pointâ€”what, we\\'ve got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri. He can\\'t come here and tell you that he\\'s left no child behind because he didn\\'t fund No Child Left Behind. So what does he do? He\\'s trying to attack me. He wants you to believe that I can\\'t be President, and he\\'s trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind. Well, let me tell you straight up, I\\'ve never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threatâ€”believed it in 1998 when Clinton was President. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. But I would have used that force wisely. I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. I would have brought our allies to our side. I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission. This President rushed to war, pushed our allies aside, and Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea with nuclear weapons. He took his eye off the ball, off of Usama bin Laden. . Senator Kerry. The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein. It was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didn\\'t have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective. And if we had used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq, and right now Usama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. That\\'s the war against terror. . Senator Kerry. Mr. Baldi. Iraq/War on Terror Anthony Baldi. Senator Kerry, the U. S. is preparing a new Iraq Government, and we\\'ll proceed to withdraw U. S. troops. Would you proceed with the same plans as President Bush? . Senator Kerry. Anthony, I would not. I have laid out a different plan because the President\\'s plan is not working. You see that every night on television. There\\'s chaos in Iraq. King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterdayâ€”or the day before, you can\\'t hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that\\'s going on today. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been \"incompetent. \" Those are the Republican chairman\\'s words. Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is \"beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing. It\\'s in the zone of dangerous. \" Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee. Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different. I would reach out to our allies in a way that this President hasn\\'t. He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U. N. , pushed them away individually. Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO. They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq. Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq? No. Were they silent? Yes. Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that? Noâ€”because they\\'ve always wanted this to be an American effort. You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying don\\'t bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren\\'t part of our original coalition. Now, that\\'s not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer. I\\'m going to get the training done for our troops. I\\'m going to get the training of Iraqis done faster, and I\\'m going to get our allies back to the table. . Senator Kerry. Yes, sir, please. Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Usama bin Laden and Afghanistan. That was the right place, and the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains. Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction. That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime. Now we have to succeed. I\\'ve always said that. I have been consistent. Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it. . Senator Kerry. Nikki, that\\'s a question that\\'s been raised by a lot of people around the country. Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the President just talked about, because every part of the President\\'s answer just now promises you more of the same over the next 4 years. The President stood right here in this hall 4 years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you: Under what circumstances would you send people to war? And his answer was: With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done. He didn\\'t do that. He broke that promise. We didn\\'t have enough forces. General Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand. And guess what? They retired General Shinseki for telling him that. This President hasn\\'t listened. I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted. I went to New York. I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable. I came away convinced that if we worked at it, if we were ready to work at letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they\\'d be there with us. But the President just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, \"Nope, sorry, time for diplomacy is over. We\\'re going. \" He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. Ladies and gentlemen, he gave you a speech and told you he\\'d plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us. He didn\\'t. He broke his word. . Senator Kerry. You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component. General Shinseki had the wisdom to say you\\'re going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace. The military\\'s job is to win the war. The President\\'s job is to win the peace. The President did not do what was necessary, didn\\'t bring in enough nations, didn\\'t deliver the help, didn\\'t close off the borders, didn\\'t even guard the ammo dumps. And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump. . Senator Kerry. Is it Randee? I\\'m sorry. Iran/North Korea Randee Jacobs. Yes, Randee. Iran sponsors terrorism and has missiles capable of hitting Israel and southern Europe. Iran will have nuclear weapons in 2 to 3 years\\' time. In the event that U. N. sanctions don\\'t stop this threat, what will you do as President? . Senator Kerry. I don\\'t think you can just rely on U. N. sanctions, Randee, but you\\'re absolutely correct. It is a threat. It\\'s a huge threat. And what\\'s interesting is it\\'s a threat that has grown while the President has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn\\'t a threat. If he\\'d let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn\\'t have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving towards nuclear weaponsâ€”some 37 tons of what they call yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uraniumâ€”while they\\'re doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb, maybeâ€”maybeâ€”to 4 to 7 bombs. For 2 years the President didn\\'t even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of people like former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now, they have the bombs, and we\\'re less safe. So what do we do? We\\'ve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans who\\'ve been involved in their initiative. We\\'ve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the President has been slow to do that even in Russia. At his pace, it\\'s going to take 13 years to reduce and get a hold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. I\\'ve proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within 4 years. And the President is moving toward the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. It\\'s very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you\\'re busy developing a new one. I\\'m going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort, and if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough. . Senator Kerry. Daniel, I don\\'t support a draft. But let me tell you where the President\\'s policies have put us. The Presidentâ€” and this is one of the reasons why I\\'m very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the President\\'s father and did a brilliant jobâ€”supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovoâ€”supporting me; because they allâ€”and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guardâ€”supporting me. Why? Because they understand that our military is overextended under this President. Our Guard and Reserves have been turned into almost active duty. You\\'ve got people doing two and three rotations. You\\'ve got stop- loss policies so people can\\'t get out when they were supposed to. You\\'ve got a backdoor draft right now, and a lot of our military are underpaid. These are families that get hurt. It hurts the middle class. It hurts communities, because these are our first- responders, and they\\'re called up, and they\\'re over there, not over here. Now, I\\'m going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military. And I\\'m going to make people feel good about being safe in our military and not overextended because I\\'m going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did and President Eisenhower did and others. We\\'re going to build alliances. We\\'re not going to go unilaterally. We\\'re not going to go alone like this President did. . Senator Kerry. Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining. Eight countries have left it. If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States. That\\'s not a grand coalition. Ninety percent of the casualties are American. Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets. I could do a better job. My plan does a better job, and that\\'s why I\\'ll be a better Commander in Chief. . Senator Kerry. Thank you very much, Ann. I\\'ve asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can\\'t go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you. This President and his administration have told you and all of us, \"It\\'s not a question of when, it\\'s a question of\"â€”excuse me, \"not a question of if, it\\'s a question of when. \" We\\'ve been told that. The \"when\" I can\\'t tell you. Between the World Trade Center bombing inâ€”what was it, 1993 or soâ€”and the next time was 5 years, 7 years. These people wait. They\\'ll plan. They plot. I agree with the President that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are. I just think I can do that far more effectively because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence. You\\'ve got to have the best intelligence in the world. And in order to have the best intelligence in the world, to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they\\'re plotting, you\\'ve got to have the best cooperation you\\'ve ever had in the world. Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we\\'re not getting the best cooperation in the world today. We\\'ve got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now. I\\'m going to change that. And I\\'m going to put in place a better homeland security effort. Look at it, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today. When you get on an airplane, your cartâ€”your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn\\'t X- rayed. Do you feel safer? This President, in the last debate, said that, well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that. Ladies and gentlemen, it\\'s his tax plan. He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible. We have bridges and tunnels that aren\\'t being secured; chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren\\'t secured; hospitals that are overcrowded in their emergency rooms. If we had a disaster today, could they handle it? This President chose a tax cut over homeland security. Wrong choice. . Senator Kerry. Well, the President and his experts have told America that it\\'s not a question of if, it\\'s a question of when. And I accept what the President has said. These terrorists are serious. They\\'re deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill. I understand that. That\\'s why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But you heard the President just say to you that we\\'ve added money. Folks, the test is not if you\\'ve added money. The test is, have you done everything possible to make America secure? He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you. . Senator Kerry. John, you heard the President just say that he thought he might try to be for it. Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question, \"Can\\'t people be able to import drugs from Canada? \" Do you know what he said? \"I think that makes sense. I think that\\'s a good idea\"â€”4 years ago. Now, the President said, \"I\\'m not blocking that. \" Ladies and gentlemen, the President just didn\\'t level with youâ€”right now, again. He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate. We sent it over to the House that you could import drugs. We took care of the safety issues. We\\'re not talking about third- world drugs. We\\'re talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them, in American bottles, and we\\'re asking they be able to allow you to get them. The President blocked it. The President also took Medicare, which belongs to you, and he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the cost to seniors. You know what he did? He made it illegalâ€” illegalâ€”for Medicare to do what the VA does, which is bulk- purchase drugs so that you could lower the price and get them out to you lower. He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies, right out of your pockets. That\\'s the difference between us. The President sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies. And I\\'m fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and I\\'m fighting to let Medicare survive. I\\'m fighting for the middle class. That\\'s the difference. . Senator Kerry. Actually, Mr. President, in 1997, we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it. We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don\\'t know how to do. We balanced the budget. And we paid down the debt of our Nation for 2 years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time. And it\\'s the President\\'s fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history. He\\'s added more debt to the debt of the United States in 4 years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together. Go figure. . Senator Kerry. Very easily. John Edwards is the author of the Patients\\' Bill of Rights. He wanted to give people rights. John Edwards and I support tort reform. We both believe that as lawyersâ€”I\\'m a lawyer tooâ€” and I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has eluded everybody else, because we know how to do it. It\\'s in my health care proposal. Go to johnkerry. comâ€”you can pull it off the Internetâ€”and you\\'ll find a tort reform plan. Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the President and his friends try to make a big deal out of it. Is it a problem? Yes, it\\'s a problem. Do we need to fix it, particularly for ob- gyns * and for brain surgeons and others? Yes. But it\\'s less than one percent of the total cost of health care. Your premiums are going up. You\\'ve gone up in Missouri about $3,500. You\\'ve gone up 64 percent. You\\'ve seen co- pays go up, deductibles go up. Everything has gone up. Five million people have lost their health insurance under this President, and he\\'s done nothing about it. I have a plan. I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you. I have a plan to cover all children. I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care Senators and Congressmen give themselves. I have a plan that\\'s going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a Federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive, and makes health care more affordable. Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing. Join me in rolling back the President\\'s unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year. That\\'s all. Ninety- eight percent of America, I\\'m giving you a tax cut, and I\\'m giving you health care. . Senator Kerry. Yes, I think we should look at the punitive, and we should have some limitations. But look, what\\'s really important, Charlie, is the President\\'s just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around. I mean, \"compassionate conservative,\" what does that mean? Cutting 500,000 kids from after- school programs? Cutting 365,000 kids from health care? Running up the biggest deficits in American history? Mr. President, you\\'re batting 0 for 2. I mean, seriously, labels don\\'t mean anything. What means something is do you have a plan, and I want to talk about my plan some more. I hope we can. . Senator Kerry. Let me begin by saying that my health care plan is not what the President described. It is not a Government takeover. You have choice: Choose your doctor; choose your plan. The Government has nothing to do with it. In fact, it doesn\\'t ask you to do anything. If you don\\'t want to take it, you don\\'t have to. If you like your high premiums, you keep them. That\\'s the way we leave it. Now, with respect to the deficit, the President was handed a $5. 6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen. That\\'s where he was when he came into office. We now have a $2. 6 trillion deficit. This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country. He\\'s the first President in 72 years to lose jobs. He talked about war. This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we\\'re at war. Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others knew how to lead. They knew how to ask the American people for the right things. One percent of Americaâ€”the highest one percent of income earners in America got $89 billion of tax cut last year. One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down. The President thinks it\\'s more important to fight for that top one percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you. I want to put money in your pocket. I amâ€”I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000. The only people affected in my plan are the top income earners of America. . Senator Kerry. After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the President asked for another tax cut and promised 5. 6 million jobs would be created. He lost 1. 6 million, ladies and gentlemen, and most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country. He came and asked for a tax cut; we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear. Do you know what he presented us with? A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America, including a $254 million refund check to Enron. Wrong priorities. You are my priority. . Senator Kerry. Absolutely. Yes. Right into the cameraâ€”yes. I am not going to raise taxes. I have a tax cut, and here\\'s my tax cut. I raise the child care credit by $1,000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids. I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents and kids, if they\\'re earning for themselves, to be able to pay for college. And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you. Every part of my program, I\\'ve shown how I\\'m going to pay for it. And I\\'ve gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work. I\\'ve even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the President\\'s deficit keeps growing. And I\\'ve said, as a pledge, I\\'m going to cut the deficit in half in 4 years. Now, I\\'m going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: Pay as you go. We\\'re going to do it like you do it. The President broke the pay- as- you- go rule. Somebody here asked the question about why haven\\'t you vetoed something. It\\'s a good question. If you care about it, why don\\'t you veto it? I think John McCain called the energy bill the no lobbyist left behind bill. I mean, you\\'ve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks. I\\'m pledging I will not raise taxes. I\\'m giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year. Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you are going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money. And looking around here at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the President, me, and Charlie, I\\'m sorry, you too. [Laughter] . Senator Kerry. Well, first of all, the President\\'s figures of 2. 2 trillion just aren\\'t accurate. Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign. That\\'s not the number. Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes. We\\'ve got $40 billion going to Bermuda. We\\'ve got all kinds of giveaways. We ought to be shutting those down. And third, credible? Ladies and gentlemen, in 1985, I was one of the first Democrats to move to balance the budget. I voted for the balanced budget in \\'93 and \\'97. We did it. We did it, and I was there. . Senator Kerry. Boy, to listen to that, the President I don\\'t think is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment. Now, if you\\'re a Red Sox fan, that\\'s okay. But if you\\'re a President, it\\'s not. Let me just say to you, number one, don\\'t throw the labels around. Labels don\\'t mean anything. I supported welfare reform. I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America. I\\'ve been for faith- based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years. I wasâ€”broke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy. Labels don\\'t fit, ladies and gentlemen. Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history. The Clear Skies bill that he just talked aboutâ€”it\\'s one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto somethingâ€”like No Child Left Behind, but you leave millions of children behind. Here they\\'re leaving the skies and the environment behind. If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the cleaner skies act. We\\'re going backwards. In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they\\'re doing to what are called the New Source Performance Standards for air quality. They\\'re going backwards on the definition for wetlands. They\\'re going backwards on the water quality. They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead; didn\\'t even accept the science. I\\'m going to be a President who believes in science. . Senator Kerry. The fact is that the Kyoto treaty was flawed. I was in Kyoto, and I was part of that. I know what happened. But this President didn\\'t try to fix it. He just declared it dead, ladies and gentlemen, and we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years. You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don\\'t like us in some parts of the world. You just say, \"Hey, we don\\'t agree with you. Goodbye. \" The President has done nothing to try to fix it. I will. . Senator Kerry. Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive. And unfortunately, again, I regret, this administration has not seized them and embraced them. Let me give you an example. There\\'s a tax loophole right nowâ€”if you\\'re a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there\\'s actually an incentive for you to go away. You get more moneyâ€”you can keep more of your taxes by going abroad. I\\'m going to shut that loophole, and I\\'m going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive. Secondly, we\\'re going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America. Third, what\\'s really hurting American business, more than anything else, is the cost of health care. Now, you didn\\'t hear any plan from the President, because he doesn\\'t have a plan to lower the cost of health care. Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under . Senator Kerry. You can\\'t stop all outsourcing, Charlie. I\\'ve never promised that. I\\'m not going to, because that would be pandering. You can\\'t. But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that\\'s what I\\'m talking about. But let me just address what the President just said. Ladies and gentlemen, that\\'s just not true, what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count? The President got $84 from a timber company that he owns, and he\\'s counted as a small business. Dick Cheney is counted as a small business. That\\'s how they do things. That\\'s just not right. . Senator Kerry. Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the PATRIOT Act has to be changed and fixed. Congressman Jim Sensenbrennerâ€”he\\'s the chairman of the House Judiciary Committeeâ€” has said over his dead body before it gets renewed without being thoroughly rechecked. Whole bunch of folks in America concerned about the way the PATRIOT Act has been applied. In fact, the Inspector General of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate. People\\'s rights have been abused. I met a man who spent 8 months in prison, wasn\\'t even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn\\'t allowed toâ€”finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out. This is in our country, folks, the United States of America. They\\'ve got sneak- and- peak searches that are allowed. They\\'ve got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings, without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise. Now, I voted for the PATRIOT Act. Ninety- nine United States Senators voted for it. And the President has been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I\\'m wishy- washy, that I\\'m a flip- flopper. Now, that\\'s not a flip- flop. I believe in the PATRIOT Act. We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA. We need to be stronger on terrorism. But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights. . Senator Kerry. You know, Elizabeth, I really respect yourâ€”the feeling that\\'s in your question. I understand it. I know the morality that\\'s prompting that question, and I respect it enormously. But like Nancy Reagan and so many other peopleâ€”you know, I was at a forum with Michael J. Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who\\'s suffering from Parkinson\\'s, and he wants us to do stem cellâ€”embryonic stem cell. And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering. His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had, and he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, you know, \"Don\\'t take away my hope because my hope is what keeps me going. \" Chris Reeve is a friend of mine. Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again. I think we can save lives. Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem cell research. We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics. These weren\\'t taken from abortion or something like that. They\\'re from a fertility clinic, and they\\'re either going to be destroyed or left frozen. And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinson\\'s, curing diabetes, curing some kind of a paraplegic or quadriplegic or a spinal cord injury, anythingâ€”that\\'s the nature of the human spirit. I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure. I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way. And the President\\'s chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that. I want the future, and I think we have to grab it. . Senator Kerry. When you talk about walking a waffle line, he says he\\'s allowed it, which means he\\'s going to allow the destruction of life up to a certain amount, and then he isn\\'t going to allow it. Now, I don\\'t know how you draw that line. But let me tell you pointblank, the lines of stem cells that he\\'s made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, \"Not adequate,\" because they\\'re contaminated by mouse cells and because there aren\\'t 60 or 70; there are only about 11 to 20 now, and there aren\\'t enough to be able to do the research because they\\'re contaminated. We\\'ve got to open up the possibilities of this research. And when I am President, I\\'m going to do it, because we have to. . Senator Kerry. Thank you, Charlie. A few years ago, when he came to office, the President saidâ€”these are his wordsâ€” \"What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts. \" And he said also that his two favorite Justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. So you get a pretty good sense of where he\\'s heading if he were to appoint somebody. Now, here\\'s what I believe. I don\\'t believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don\\'t believe we need a good liberal judge. I don\\'t believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side. I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard. He was a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States, and he said the mark of a good judge, a good Justice, is that when you\\'re reading their decision, their opinion, you can\\'t tell if it\\'s written by a man or a woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew, or a Christian. You just know you\\'re reading a good judicial decision. What I want to find, if I\\'m privileged to have the opportunity to do itâ€”and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen, the future of things that matter to you in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you\\'ll have, whether we\\'ll enforce the law, will we have equal opportunity, will women\\'s rights be protected, will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards, will a woman\\'s right to choose be protected. These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law. . Senator Kerry. I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now. First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. I\\'m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today. But I can\\'t take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn\\'t share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can\\'t do that. But I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife, Teresa, does, about making other choices and about abstinence and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society. But as a President, I have to represent all the people in the Nation, and I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion. But you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don\\'t deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the Constitution affords them if they can\\'t afford it otherwise. That\\'s why I think it\\'s important. That\\'s why I think it\\'s important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning. You\\'ll help prevent AIDS. You\\'ll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. You\\'ll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question, and I truly respect it. . Senator Kerry. Well, again, the President just said categorically, \"My opponent is against this. My opponent is against that. \" It\\'s just not that simple. No, I\\'m not. I\\'m against the partial- birth abortion, but you\\'ve got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother. Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I\\'m not going to require a 16-  or 17- year old kid who\\'s been raped by her father and who\\'s pregnant to have to notify her father. So you\\'ve got to have a judicial intervention. And because they didn\\'t have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it. It\\'s never quite as simple as the President wants you to believe. . Senator Kerry. I believe the President made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job, and go through the U. N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort. I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your gutsâ€”gut- check time. Was this really going to war as a last resort? The President rushed our Nation to war without a plan to win the peace, and simple things weren\\'t done. That\\'s why Senator Lugar says \"incompetent\" in the delivery of services. That\\'s why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, \"beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous. \" We didn\\'t guard 850,000 tons of ammo. That ammo is now being used against our kids. Ten thousand out of twelve thousand Humvees aren\\'t armored. I\\'ve visited some of those kids with no limbs today because they didn\\'t have the armor on those vehicles. They didn\\'t have the right body armor. I\\'ve met parents who\\'ve, on the Internet, gotten the armor to send their kids. There\\'s no bigger judgment for a President of the United States than how you take a nation to war. And you can\\'t say, \"Because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that\\'s a reason. \" That\\'s an excuse. . Senator Kerry. Not necessarily be in power. But here\\'s what I\\'ll say about the 87 billion: I made a mistake in the way I talked about it. He made a mistake in invading Iraq. Which is a worse decision? Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong, and I wanted accountability. I didn\\'t want to give a slush fund to Halliburton. I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it, ladies and gentlemen. He wants your kids to pay for it. I wanted us to pay for it, since we\\'re at war. I don\\'t think that\\'s a bad decision. Closing Statements . Senator Kerry. I believe that was the agreement. . Senator Kerry. You want to go first? . Senator Kerry. Thank you. Charlie, thank you. And thank you all. Thank you, all of you, for taking part; thanks for your questions tonight very, very much. Obviously, the President and I both have very strong convictions. I respect him for that, but we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer. I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation. I\\'ll never give a veto of American security to any other entity, not a nation, not a country, not an institution. But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances. And that\\'s the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it. We are not doing that today. We need to. I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists, and I will not stop in our effort to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But I also have a better plan on how we\\'re going to deal with Iraq, training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a President whose judgment the rest of the world trusts. In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health care costs going up. I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans. I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards, but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind. I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents. That\\'s the test. I believe America\\'s best days are ahead of us. I\\'m an optimist. But we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future. We can do this. And I ask you for the privilege of leading our Nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world. Thank you. . Senator Kerry. That concludes tonight\\'s debate. I want to give you a reminder that the third and final debate, on issues of domestic policy, will be held next Wednesday, October 13th, at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, hosted by Bob Schieffer of CBS News. I want to thank President Bush and Senator Kerry for tonight. I want to thank these citizens of the St. Louis area who asked the questions, who gave so willingly of their time, and who took their responsibility very seriously. Thank you also to everyone at Washington. I want to thank everyone at Washington University in St. Louis for being such gracious hosts. I\\'m Charles Gibson from ABC News. From St. Louis, good night.

I never said that all. I was asked a question about the mathematics of election, and I answered a question about the mathematics with respect to Al Gore\\'s election. But I\\'ve always said I will compete in the South. I\\'ve always said I think I can win the South. (APPLAUSE) And I don\\'t believe that Senator Fritz Hollings or Congressman Jim Clyburn have endorsed me because I don\\'t believe that we can win the South. I think we can. In fact, I think the person who has to worry about coming down to the South and campaigning is President George Bush, who\\'s had 36 months of sustained loss of manufacturing jobs, who has ignored health care, who\\'s turned his back on the schools in the South and who is fundamentally the worst administration in modern history with respect to the environment. And his foreign policy has been reckless and arrogant and led America to break our relationships around the globe. People in the South care about their jobs. They care about health care. They care about safety. They care about cops in the street. They care about their children. And I\\'m going to talk mainstream American values. And I intend to win in the South and campaign all across it. . : There is a very legitimate question, Tom, about what the vice president of the United States was doing at the CIA. There\\'s an enormous question about the exaggeration by this administration. But the most important point - -  and I think this is the larger issue of how you choose somebody to run and to be president of the United States. The president gave guarantees not just to the Congress and to the American people, but to the world, about how he would conduct himself as president. He said he would build a legitimate global coalition. He said he would respect the United Nations inspection process and work through it. And he said to the American people he would go to war only as a last resort. I will tell you, and I think General Clark will share this, that those who\\'ve been to war know that the words \"last resort\" are important. And I intend to hold him accountable in this election, because the American people\\'s pockets are being picked to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, and our troops are at greater risk than they needed to be. And we deserve leadership that knows how to take a nation to war if you have to. . : I think it\\'s somewhere in between. I think that there has been an exaggeration and there has been a refocusing. . . . : Well, 45 minutes deployment of weapons of mass destruction, number one. Aerial vehicles to be able to deliver materials of mass destruction, number two. I mean, I - -  nuclear weapons, number three. I could run a long list of clear misleading, clear exaggeration. The linkage to Al Qaida, number four. That said, they are really misleading all of America, Tom, in a profound way. The war on terror is less - -  it is occasionally military, and it will be, and it will continue to be for a long time. And we will need the best- trained and the most well- equipped and the most capable military, such as we have today. But it\\'s primarily an intelligence and law enforcement operation that requires cooperation around the world - -  the very thing this administration is worst at. And most importantly, the war on terror is also an engagement in the Middle East economically, socially, culturally, in a way that we haven\\'t embraced, because otherwise we\\'re inviting a clash of civilizations. And I think this administration\\'s arrogant and ideological policy is taking America down a more dangerous path. I will make America safer than they are. . : Well, Tom, you don\\'t cut the benefits to people that you\\'ve promised. You can do things to guarantee that you keep Medicare solvent, as we\\'ve done. We did that in the United States Congress. And we did it with respect to Social Security. And this president wants to privatize Social Security, which will in fact make it more at risk than it is today. One of the things we haven\\'t talked about yet, if you want to talk about how we\\'re going to help people, the critical issue on the minds of most people in South Carolina and across the country is health care costs themselves. . : Oh, OK. Well, I thought I\\'d just. . . (LAUGHTER) Because that\\'s part of the solution to the Medicare problem, is the overall - -  for instance, in Medicare, 55 percent, 50 percent of the cost is going to 5 percent of the people for Alzheimer\\'s. If we had a medical care system in this country that dealt better with research, with prevention, with wellness, with the whole parameter of health care issues, we could begin to reduce the costs of Medicare. The problem is, this administration has only one plan: savings accounts for people who are able to save - -  that\\'s it. That\\'s not a plan. I have a plan that will provide health care to all Americans, that will lower the cost of health care for Americans, and I think that\\'s a critical way to save Medicare and strengthen the entire health care system of our country. . : Well, one of the things that you need to know as a president is how things work in Congress if you want to get things done. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) And one of the things that happens in Congress is, you can in fact write a bill, but if you\\'re smart about it, you can get your bill passed on someone else\\'s bill and it doesn\\'t carry your name. In addition to that, we did mental health parity. We did child care - -  5 million children have health insurance in this country. Some of them in Vermont were helped. And I think that it\\'s time to recognize that we got a lot done on health care. And when I\\'m president of the United States, I will complete the mission of Harry Truman, and all Americans will have health care in this country. (APPLAUSE) . : And that\\'s precisely why I\\'m running for president of the United States and why I intend to be elected, because I believe we can set a better agenda at the national level than this president is willing to. Fritz Hollings and I worked together to try to pass three different textile bills. We passed them to help the textile workers of South Carolina. They were vetoed by Republican presidents. That\\'s the problem today. We have a president who is not on the side of the average working people. He is on the side of the drug lobbyists and the big powerful entities, the HMOs. I have a message for them: We\\'re coming. They\\'re going. And don\\'t let the door hit them on the way out. . : Actually, Tom, that\\'s not what I said. What I described was what the critics were saying about it and about the growing questions about it. And I was part of the same movement that Jim Clyburn and Bill Clinton were, the \"mend it, don\\'t end it. \" There were a great many questions in the country about how it was being implemented. We wanted to keep it. I\\'ve always supported it. In the very speech in which I raised what those perceptions were, I said at the beginning, \"I support affirmative action. \" I said at the end, \"I support affirmative action. \" . Senator Kerry. [Applause] Good evening, Mr. President, . Senator Kerry. As determined by a coin toss, the first question goes to you, . Senator Kerry. You have 2 minutes. Preventing Future Terrorist Attacks Do you believe you could do a better job than President Bush in preventing another 9/11- type terrorist attack on the United States? . Senator Kerry. Yes, I do. But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating. I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us. And I know the President will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. You\\'ve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you, and we admire your pluck and perseverance. I can make America safer than President Bush has made us. And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally, but we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe. I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and when we are leading strong alliances. I\\'ll never give a veto to any country over our security, but I also know how to lead those alliances. This President has left them in shatters across the globe, and we\\'re now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs. I think that\\'s wrong, and I think we can do better. I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror: by strengthening our military; strengthening our intelligence; by going after the financing more authoritatively; by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances; by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the President has almost not done; and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America. I know I can do a better job in Iraq, where I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this President has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves. And I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections. All of these, and especially homeland security, which we\\'ll talk about a little bit later. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. I believe in being strong and resolute and determined, and I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. But we also have to be smart, Jim, and smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Usama bin Laden and taking it off to Iraq, where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This President has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the President of the United States of America. I\\'m proud that important military figures are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday General Eisenhower\\'s son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; Generalâ€”Admiral William Crowe; General Tony McPeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father. All believe I would make a stronger Commander in Chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal, Usama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didn\\'t use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The President relied on Afghan warlords that he outsourced that job to. That\\'s wrong. President\\'s Judgment on Foreign Policy . Senator Kerry. \"Colossal\" misjudgmentsâ€” what colossal misjudgments, in your opinion, has President Bush made in these areas? . Senator Kerry. Well, where do you want me to begin? [Laughter] First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didn\\'t even want to do that, and it wasn\\'t until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said, \"You\\'ve got to go to the U. N. ,\" that the President finally changed his mindâ€” his campaign has a word for thatâ€”and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat, \"last resort. \" You\\'ve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, \"I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter. \" I don\\'t believe the United States did that, and we pushed our allies aside. And so today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost, $200 billionâ€”$200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it\\'s in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before, where the opium production is 75 percent of the world\\'s opium production, where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium, where the elections have been postponed 3 times. The President moved the troops, so he\\'s got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Usama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Usama bin Ladenâ€” excuse meâ€”Saddam Hussein more important than Usama bin Laden? I don\\'t think so. . Senator Kerry. The President just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the President invaded it. The President made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it, to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq. And he rushed to war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a President of the United States ought to make. You don\\'t take America to war unless you have a plan to win the peace. You don\\'t send troops to war without the body armor that they need. I\\'ve met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin, placesâ€”Iowa, where they\\'re going out on the Internet to get the state- of- the- art body gear to send to their kidsâ€”some of them have got them for a birthday present. I think that\\'s wrong. Humveesâ€”10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren\\'t armored. And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don\\'t have the armament. This President justâ€”I don\\'t know if he sees what\\'s really happening out there, but it\\'s getting worse by the dayâ€”more soldiers killed in June than before, more in July than June, more in August than July, more in September than in August. And now we see beheadings, and we\\'ve got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they\\'re blowing people up. And we don\\'t have enough troops there. . Senator Kerry. Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am. And I will succeed for those troops, now that we\\'re there. We have to succeed. We can\\'t leave a failed Iraq. But that doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Usama bin Laden. It was. Now, we can succeed, but I don\\'t believe this President can. I think we need a President who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what\\'s necessary to make it so America isn\\'t doing this alone. Homeland Security . Senator Kerry. Jim, let me tell you exactly what I\\'ll do, and there are a long list of things. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you\\'ve got $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq and the President is cutting the COPS program in America? What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we\\'re shutting firehouses, who are the first- responders, here in America? The President hasn\\'t put one nickelâ€” not one nickelâ€”into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. That\\'s why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadn\\'t done the work that ought to be done. The Presidentâ€”95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and theirâ€”their luggage is X- rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed. Does that make you feel safer in America? This President thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those aren\\'t my values. I believe in protecting America first. And long before President Bush and I get a tax cutâ€”and that\\'s who gets itâ€”long before we do, I\\'m going to invest in homeland security, and I\\'m going to make sure we\\'re not cutting COPS programs in America, and we\\'re fully staffed at our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. The President also, unfortunately, gave in to the chemical industry, which didn\\'t want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. And there\\'s an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. That\\'s a whole other subject, butâ€”I see we still have a little bit more time. Let me just quickly say, at the current pace the President will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Unionâ€”former Soviet Union for 13 years. I\\'m going to do it in 4 years. And we\\'re going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists. . Senator Kerry. The President just said the FBI had changed its culture. We just read on the front pages of America\\'s papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes unlistened to. On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time. And the test is not whether you\\'re spending more money. The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe? We didn\\'t need that tax cut. America needed to be safe. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. Thank you, Jim. My message to the troops is also \"Thank you\" for what they\\'re doing, but it\\'s also, \"Help is on the way. \" I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today. You know, it\\'s interesting, when I was in the ropeline just the other day coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said, \"We need you. You\\'ve got to help us over there. \" Now, I believe there\\'s a better way to do this. You know, the President\\'s father did not go into Iraqâ€”into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didn\\'t is, he saidâ€”he wrote in his book, because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. That\\'s exactly where we find ourselves today. There\\'s a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops went into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didn\\'t guard the nuclear facilities. We didn\\'t guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didn\\'t guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. I know what it\\'s like to go out on one of those missions where you don\\'t know what\\'s around the corner. And I believe our troops need other allies helping. I\\'m going to hold that summit. I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right. . Senator Kerry. Let\\'s change the rules. We can add a wholeâ€”[inaudible]. . Senator Kerry. Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war. But the President made a mistake in invading Iraq. Which is worse? I believe that when you know something\\'s going wrong, you make it right. That\\'s what I learned in Vietnam. When I came back from that war, I saw that it was wrong. Some people don\\'t like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did. And that\\'s what I did with that vote. And I\\'m going to lead those troops to victory. Planning and International Cooperation in Iraq . Senator Kerry. Speaking of Vietnam, you spoke to Congress in 1971, after you came back from Vietnam, and you said, quote, \"How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake? \" Are Americans now dying in Iraq for a mistake? . Senator Kerry. No, and they don\\'t have to, providing we have the leadership that we putâ€”that I\\'m offering. I believe that we have to win this. The President and I have always agreed on that. And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat. And I did accept thatâ€”that intelligence. But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from the position of strength, and the President, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati, and he gave a speech in which he said, \"We will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies. \" He didn\\'t do any of those things. They didn\\'t do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department on the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, said, \"You\\'re going to need several hundred thousand troops. \" Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every President since Ronald Reagan, said, \"Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor. \" That\\'s what we have here. And what we need now is a President who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. They\\'ve always had stakes in it. The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. But this President hasn\\'t even held the kind of statesmanlike summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those stakes. In fact, he\\'s done the opposite; he pushed them away. When the Secretary- General, Kofi Annan, offered the United Nations, he said, \"No, no, we\\'ll go do this alone. \" To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, \"If you weren\\'t with us in the war, don\\'t bother applying for any construction. \" That\\'s not a way to invite people. . Senator Kerry. The United Nations\\' Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell. And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction. It was always American- run. Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries, Great Britain, Australia, and the United States. That\\'s not a grand coalition. We can do better. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the President has just sort of described one kind of mistake, but what he has said is that even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection of Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way. Those are his words. Now, I would not. So what I\\'m trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world. Truth is what good policy is based on. It\\'s what leadership is based on. The President says that I\\'m denigrating these troops. I have nothing but respect for the British and for Tony Blair and for what they\\'ve been willing to do. But you can\\'t tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain with 8,300, and below that, the 4 others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn\\'t anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done. You can\\'t tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started, it was principally the United States, theâ€”America and Great Britain and one or two others; that\\'s it. And today we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs. And meanwhile, North Korea has gotten nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages, the President is the one who said we can\\'t allow countries to get nuclear weapons. They have. I\\'ll change that. Candidates\\' Candor and Consistency . Senator Kerry. Well, I\\'ve never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then, and I try not to. I\\'ve beenâ€”but I\\'ll, nevertheless, tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people, and I\\'ll tell you exactly how. First of all, we all know that in his State of the Union Message he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn\\'t exist. We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. I just described the coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this. The President said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didn\\'t. He cut it off, sort of arbitrarily. And we know that there were further diplomaticsâ€”efforts underway. They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards. Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said, \"We will plan carefully. \" They obviously didn\\'t. He misled the American people when he said, \"We\\'d go to war as a last resort. \" We did not go as a last resort. And most Americans know the difference. Now, this has cost us deeply in the world. I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people. I\\'ve worked with those leaders the President talks about. I\\'ve worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this President, and I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table. And I believe that fresh start, new credibility, a President who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world, to make it clear that this is notâ€” you know, Usama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say theâ€”America has declared war on Islam. We need to be smarter about how we wage a war on terror. We need to deny them the recruits. We need to deny them the safe havens. We need to rebuild our alliances. I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and others did that more effectively, and I\\'m going to try to follow in their footsteps. . Senator Kerry. I wasn\\'t misleading when I said he was a threat. Nor was I misleading on the day that the President decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy. I\\'ve had one position, one consistent position, that Sad- dam Hussein was a threat; there was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way. And the President chose the wrong way. . Senator Kerry. I understand what the President is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat. And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war, and it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors. That happened before. And that\\'s one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined, for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the lineâ€”that is noble. That\\'s the most noble thing that anybody can do. And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility. Now, we have a choice here. I\\'ve laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq, with a summit, by doing better training faster, by cuttingâ€”by doing what we need to do with respect to the U. N. and the elections. There\\'s only 25 percent of the people in there. They can\\'t have an election right now. The President is not getting the job done. So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I\\'ve laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about, or you can go to johnkerry. com and see more of it, or you have the President\\'s plan, which is four words, \"More of the same. \" I think my plan is better. And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops. I will never let those troops down and will hunt and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. . Senator Kerry. Secretary of State Colin Powell told this President the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it. Now, if you break it, you made a mistake. It\\'s the wrong thing to do, but you own it. And then you\\'ve got to fix it and do something with it. Now, that\\'s what we have to do. There\\'s no inconsistency. Soldiers know, over there, that this isn\\'t being done right yet. I\\'m going to get it right for those soldiers, because it\\'s important to Israel. It\\'s important to America. It\\'s important to the world. It\\'s important to the fight on terror. But I have a plan to do it. He doesn\\'t. Timeline for Withdrawal From Iraq/ Conditions in Iraq . Senator Kerry. The timeline that I\\'ve set outâ€”and again, I want to correct the President, because he\\'s misled again this evening on what I\\'ve said. I didn\\'t say I would bring troops out in 6 months. I said, \"If we do the things that I\\'ve set out, and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in 6 months. \" And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn\\'t have long- term designs on it. As I understand it, we\\'re building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they\\'ve got a rather permanent concept to them. When youâ€”when you guard the oil ministry but you don\\'t guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is, \"Maybeâ€”well, maybe they\\'re interested in our oil. \" Now, the problem is that they didn\\'t think these things through properly, and these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of Fallujahs and other places and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. You\\'ve got to show you\\'re serious in that regard. But you\\'ve also got to show that you\\'re prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long- term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal, in my administration, would be to get all of the troops out of there, with the minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But that\\'s how we\\'re going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves. Even the administration has admitted they haven\\'t done the training, because they came to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money. Now, what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards, \"Oops, we haven\\'t done the job. We\\'ve got to start to spend the money now. Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training? \" . Senator Kerry. I couldn\\'t agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free. But I think the President, again, still hasn\\'t shown how he\\'s going to go about it the right way. He has more of the same. Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. That\\'s Allawi\\'s assessment. The national intelligence assessment that was given to the President in July said: Best case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst case scenario, civil war. I can do better. . Senator Kerry. Jim, the President just said something extraordinarily revealing and, frankly, very important in this debate. In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, \"The enemy attacked us. \" Saddam Hussein didn\\'t attack us. Usama bin Laden attacked us. Al Qaida attacked us. And when we had Usama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains, with the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn\\'t use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world\\'s number one criminal and terrorist. They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other. That\\'s the enemy that attacked us. That\\'s the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains. That\\'s the enemy that is now in 60 countries with stronger recruits. He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger. That is just factually incorrect. Two- thirds of the country was a no- fly zone when we started this war. We would have had sanctions. We would have had the U. N. inspectors. Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening. If the President had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders and say, \"What do you need? What do you need now? How much more will it take to get you to join us,\" we would be in a stronger place today. . Senator Kerry. Thirty- five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the President invaded than Saddam Hussein. And while he has been diverted with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea\\'s got nuclear weapons, and the world is more dangerous. Iran is moving towards nuclear weapons, and the world is more dangerous. Darfur has a genocide. The world is more dangerous. I\\'d have made a better choice. Preemptive Action/International Cooperation . Senator Kerry. What is your position on the whole concept of preemptive war? . Senator Kerry. The President always has the right and always has had the right for preemptive strike. That was a great doctrine throughout the cold war, and it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control. No President, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America. But if and when you do it, Jim, you\\'ve got to do in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test, where your countrymen, your people, understand fully why you\\'re doing what you\\'re doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons. Here we have our own Secretary of State who\\'s had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations. I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy, in the Cuban missile crisis, sent his Secretary of State to Paris to meet with de Gaulle, and in the middle of the discussion to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, \"Here, let me show you the photos. \" And de Gaulle waved them off and said, \"No, no, no, no. The word of the President of the United States is good enough for me. \" How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we\\'ve done, in that way? So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world. Iran and Iraq are now moreâ€”Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous. Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen or not, I don\\'t know yet. But I\\'ll tell you this, as President, I\\'ll never take my eye off that ball. I\\'ve been fighting for proliferation the entire timeâ€”antiproliferation the entire time I\\'ve been in the Congress. And we\\'ve watched this President actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table. You don\\'t help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations. You have to earn that respect. And I think we have a lot of earning back to do. . Senator Kerry. With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effortâ€”without the United States, regrettablyâ€”to begin to try to move to deter the nuclear possibilities in Iran. I believe we could have done better. I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them to see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes. If they weren\\'t willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. The President did nothing. With respect to North Korea, the real story, we had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were, and we knew the limits on their nuclear power. Colin Powell, our Secretary of State, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog and work with the North Koreans. The President reversed him publicly, while the President of South Korea was here. And the President of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. And for 2 years, this administration didn\\'t talk at all to North Korea. While they didn\\'t talk at all, the fuel rods came out. The inspectors were kicked out. The television cameras were kicked out. And, today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea. That happened on this President\\'s watch. Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious sort of reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send. . Senator Kerry. Both. I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues from the Armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues, and the nuclear issues on the table. . Senator Kerry. You mentioned Darfur, the Darfur region of Sudan. Fifty thousand people have already died in that area, more than a million are homeless, and it\\'s been labeled an act of ongoing genocide. Yet, neither one of you or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find has discussed the possibility of sending in troops. Why not? . Senator Kerry. Well, I\\'ll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran. Only the United States put the sanctions on, alone, and that\\'s exactly what I\\'m talking about. In order for the sanctions to be effective we should have been working with the British, French, and Germans and other countries. And that\\'s the difference between the President and me. And there again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that we\\'re not saying send American troops in at this point is several- fold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now, all the President is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. They\\'ve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing, and that\\'s going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it isâ€”one of the reasons we can\\'t do it is we\\'re overextended. Ask the people in the Armed Forces today. We\\'ve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. We\\'ve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today, people with stop- loss programs where they\\'re told, \"You can\\'t get out of the military,\" 9 out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming, or preparing. So this is the way the President has overextended the United States. That\\'s why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of Special Forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect to fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But I\\'ll tell you this, as President, if it took American forces, to some degree, to coalesce the African Union, I\\'d be prepared to do it, because we could never allow another Rwanda. It\\'s a moral responsibility for us in the world. . Senator Kerry. Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the President just made, and I share them with him. I think only if you\\'veâ€”if you\\'re doing this, and he\\'s done it more than I have in terms of the Presidency, can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families. And it\\'s tough. And so I acknowledge his daughters. I\\'ve watched them. I\\'ve chuckled a few times at some of their comments. [Laughter] Andâ€”â€” . Senator Kerry. Well, I know, I\\'ve learned not to do that. [Laughter] And I have great respect and admiration for his wife. I think she\\'s a terrific personâ€”â€” . Senator Kerry. â€”â€”and a great First Lady. But we do have differences. I\\'m not going to talk about a difference of character. I don\\'t think that\\'s my job or my business. But let me talk about something that the President just sort of finished up withâ€”maybe someone would call it a character trait; maybe somebody wouldn\\'tâ€”but this issue of certainty. It\\'s one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong. It\\'s another to be certain and be right, or be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right. What I worry about with the President is that he\\'s not acknowledging what\\'s on the ground. He\\'s not acknowledging the realities of North Korea. He\\'s not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem cell research or of global warming and other issues. And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble. . Senator Kerry. I have no intention of wilting. I\\'ve never wilted in my life, and I\\'ve never wavered in my life. I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq and my position has been consistent. Saddam Hussein is a threat. He needed to be disarmed. We needed to go to the U. N. The President needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something because he never did it without the threat of force, but we didn\\'t need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. Nuclear Proliferation . Senator Kerry. If you are elected President, what will you take to that office thinking is the single most serious threat to the national security of the United States? . Senator Kerry. Nuclear proliferationâ€” nuclear proliferation. There are some 600- plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union, in Russia. At the rate that the President is currently securing that, it will take 13 years to get it. I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years agoâ€”maybe 6 or 7 years ago, called \"The New War,\" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it, and the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this President, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last 2 years since 9/11 than we did in the 2 years preceding 9/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you can\\'t cut the money for it. The President actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the President is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker- busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn\\'t make sense. You talk about mixed messages. We\\'re telling other people, \"You can\\'t have nuclear weapons,\" but we\\'re pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this President. I\\'m going to shut that program down, and we\\'re going to make it clear to the world we\\'re serious about containing nuclear proliferation. And we\\'re going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in 4 years. And we\\'re going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation. This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It\\'s our generation\\'s equivalent, and I intend to get it done. . Senator Kerry. Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation. But again, the test of the difference between usâ€”the President has had 4 years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons. Iran is moving towards weapons. And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia. I\\'m going to do it in 4 years, and I\\'m going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea. . Senator Kerry. . Senator Kerry. Well, let me just say quickly that I\\'ve had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation, and I was probably one of the first Senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former Senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them. And it sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make. I regret what\\'s happened in these past months, and I think it goes beyond just the response to terror. Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations. His political opposition is being put in jail. And I think it\\'s very important for the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good. This is a very important country to us, and we want a partnership. But we always have to stand up for democracy. As George Will said the other day, \"Freedom on the march, not in Russia right now. \" Now, I\\'d like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks, because that\\'s one of the most critical issues here, North Korea. Just because the President says it can\\'t be done, that you\\'d lose China, doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t be done. I mean, this is the President who said there were weapons of mass destruction, said \"mission accomplished,\" said we could fight the war on the cheap, none of which were true. We can have bilateral talks with Kim Chong- il, and we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China, because China has an interest in the outcome too. . Senator Kerry. It was a threat. That\\'s not the issue. The issue is what you do about it. The President said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U. N. , and go to war as a last resort. Those words really have to mean something. And unfortunately, he didn\\'t go to war as a last resort. Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq, $200 billionâ€”it\\'sâ€” it\\'s not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted. Closing Statements . Senator Kerry. Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you very much to the university again. Thank you, Mr. President. My fellow Americans, as I said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much. There is no doubt, I think, about that. But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world. I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know, who is the person who could be a Commander in Chief who can get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace? And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to a school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they\\'re going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I\\'ve defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as President of the United States. But I have a difference with this President. I believe we\\'re strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances. I have a plan for Iraq. I believe we can be successful. I\\'m not talking about leaving. I\\'m talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a President who can bring allies to our side. I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting off finances, reaching out to the worldâ€”again, building strong alliances. I believe America\\'s best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. That\\'s the country that I\\'m going to fight for, and I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud. I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great Nation so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve. Thank you, and God bless America. .', 'LIEBERMAN': ' : Yes. . . . : Right. . : It is. One thing you\\'re finding in our answers, Tom: Candidates who run for president are very optimistic people. (LAUGHTER) And so I intend to win some. And I\\'m real glad to be facing February 3rd. I always said that the primary in South Carolina and the six other states would be the first big test of my presidential candidacy. I\\'m the one experienced moderate in this field. And in states like this, it is only moderate Democrats who win elections. So I look forward to Tuesday, carrying my message, big endorsement today from the Arizona Republic. And it had a message for the voters here to be bold. Don\\'t just be an echo of New Hampshire. I congratulate John Kerry on his victory, there. But this is an opportunity for folks here to send a separate message of their own to the rest of the nation about nominating a Democrat like myself, a moderate, strong on defense, strong on civil rights, fiscally responsible, strong on values, who actually can do it. We all want to do it, right? Defeat George W. Bush and give America a fresh start. (APPLAUSE) . : It\\'s a very important question. I seriously doubt whether Libya would have given up its weapons of mass destruction if we had not overthrown Saddam Hussein. I seriously doubt if the Iranians would have allowed international inspectors come in and looked at their nuclear weapons sites if we had not done that. We live in a dangerous world. I\\'ve been a senior member of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate. I\\'ve worked to keep our military strong and to know that in a dangerous world, sometimes you have to use it - -  that power against dangerous people. The statements that this administration made before the war, the questions we now have about the intelligence about weapons of mass destruction, the failure of the Bush administration to be prepared for what to do after we overthrew Saddam have all unfortunately given a bad name to a just war. So I will never waiver in my conclusion that the world and America are safer with Saddam Hussein in prison and not in power, and thanks to the American military for bringing that result about. (APPLAUSE) . : Yes, it is a legitimate position in the final analysis. But let me just tell you a brief story. I met in a hotel in Nashua, New Hampshire. Turned out to be a security guard. And he came over to me and said, \"I\\'m going to support you in the primary, and I want you to know why. I have a son who\\'s a Marine. He\\'s going to be deployed to Iraq. And I trust my son\\'s life to you as commander in chief. \" Well, I was stopped by that, honored by his confidence, and aware of the awesome responsibility that comes with this job. But he went on to make clear what he meant, and he was right: \"I know that as commander in chief, you will not commit America\\'s sons and daughters to war unless there is no other alternative. \"But, two, you will make effort when you do so to have international help. \"Three, if you still feel it is in the security interests of the United States, of course, as commander of chief, you will reserve the right to act alone to protect the security and freedom of the American people. . : That\\'s right. . : It was not a mistake. Very important to say that all of us up here, and all Democrats, rightfully brag about the Clinton economic record. Twenty- two million new jobs created in the eight years. Trade was a key part of that, and NAFTA, though it\\'s cost some jobs, has actually netted out 900,000 new jobs that were created by NAFTA. Now, the jobs that are leaving South Carolina, very few of them are going to Mexico and Canada. They\\'re going to Asia. And there the Bush administration hasn\\'t had the guts to stand up to China, and other countries there, who are ripping off patents and copyrights of ours, who are fixing their currency in a way that gives them a price advantage and causes jobs here to be bled out of the country. But, you know, I have said that I would give the same answer everywhere. It\\'s not right to make a scapegoat of trade. We have to fight for fairer trade. We have to support manufacturing. But let me say this, Tom, if some of my friends up here carried out their protectionist policies and we got in a trade war, you can\\'t create jobs by building a wall around America. In South Carolina, the state department of commerce tells me that 160,000 jobs are dependent on exports. So we got to figure out how to keep the jobs who are here, stop the bleeding and work together with business and workers to create a whole new generation of jobs. I\\'ve got a plan to create 10 million in four years. . : Tom, I wanted to respond first to what was said earlier by saying, again, that I\\'m the experienced moderate in this race. The experienced centrist. And part of what that means is that I have the capacity not only to unite Democrats, but to get independents and disgruntled Republicans to come together so I can actually get elected and defeat George Bush. But beyond that, it means that I have the capacity - -  and my record over my career shows it - -  to bring together people across party lines to get things done. I\\'m sick and tired of the partisan reflex politics in Washington. The president\\'s State of the Union, half the people stand up in Congress, half sit down. That\\'s not good for America. And one of the things we will do when we\\'re one nation is to end the moral outrage of 44 million people without health insurance in the richest country in the world. Nine million children whose parents can\\'t take them to the doctor when they get sick because they can\\'t pay the bill. I\\'m going to do that, and also help the millions who have insurance and can\\'t pay it by creating national health insurance pools, like the one\\'s members of Congress get our insurance from. Promises when you\\'re born a child in America, you get a membership card in MediKids, covers your insurance. Two, if you lose your job, you will not lose your health insurance. Three, underemployed, self- employed, small business, you can buy into this plan, it\\'ll cost you a lot less, and, incidentally, you\\'ll get drug benefits with it. That\\'s the kind of centrist leadership that produces results. And that\\'s the kind of president America needs and I\\'ll be. (APPLAUSE) . : That was probably the singular largest undone work of the Clinton administration that they wanted to do. But look at how much was done when we had a New Democratic, centrist president: welfare reform, a fiscal surplus, 22 million new jobs, a great anti-  crime program, AmeriCorps. George Bush thinks all you\\'ve got to do is use your military power and it doesn\\'t matter how much disrespect you show to the rest of the world. That\\'s not the path to ultimate security. .', 'GIBSON': ' Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, I would follow up, but we have a series of questions on Iraq, and so I will turn to the next questioner. The question for President Bush, and the questioner is Robin Dahle. Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction Robin Dahle. Mr. Presidentâ€”â€” . Mr. Gibson. Can you get a microphone, Robin, I\\'m sorry. Mr. Dahle. Mr. President, yesterday in a statement you admitted that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction but justified the invasion by stating, I quote, \"He retained the knowledge, the materials, the means, and the intent to produce weapons of mass destruction and could have passed this knowledge to our terrorist enemies. \" Do you sincerely believe this to be a reasonable justification for invasion when this statement applies to so many other countries, including North Korea? . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, I do want to follow up on this one, because there were several questions from the audience along this line. . Mr. Gibson. Well, I was going to have you do it with the rebuttal. But you go ahead. [Laughter] You\\'re up. . Mr. Gibson. Senator? . Mr. Gibson. We\\'re going to have another question now on the subject of Iraq. And I\\'m just going to turn to Anthony Baldi with a question for . Mr. Gibson. Do you want to follow up, Senator? . Mr. Gibson. The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Nikki Washington. President\\'s Decisionmaking on Iraq Nikki Washington. Thank you. Mr. President, my mother and sister traveled abroad this summer, and when they got back, they talked to us about how shocked they were at the intensity of aggravation that other countries had with how we handled the Iraq situation. Diplomacy is, obviously, something that we have to really work on. What is your plan to repair relations with other countries, given the current situation? . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. Senator. . Mr. Gibson. The next question is for Senator Kerry, and it comes from over here, from Randee Jacobs. You\\'ll need a microphone. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. We\\'re going to move on, Mr. President, with a question for you. And it comes from Daniel Farley. Mr. Farley. Possibility of Reinstating the Draft Daniel Farley. Mr. President, since we continue to police the world, how do you intend to maintain a military presence without reinstituting a draft? . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, let\\'s extend for a minute. . Mr. Gibson. Exactly. And with Reservists being held on duty and some soldiersâ€”â€” . Mr. Gibson. I wanted to get into the issue of the backdoor draft. . Mr. Gibson. Senator. . Mr. Gibson. The next question, Senator Kerry, is for you, and it comes from Ann Bronsing, who I believe is over in this area. Terrorist Attacks/Homeland Security Ann Bronsing. Senator Kerry, we have been fortunate that there have been no further terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11. Why do you think this is? And if elected, what will you do to assure our safety? . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. I want to extend for a minute, Senator, and I\\'m curious about something you said. You said, \"It\\'s not when but if. \" You think it\\'s inevitable? Because the sense of security is a very basic thing with everybody in this country, worried about their kids. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, we\\'re going to turn to questions now on domestic policy, and we\\'re going to start with health issues. And the first question is for President Bush, and it\\'s from John Horstman. Drug Imports From Canada/Health Care John Horstman. Mr. President, why did you block the reimportation of safer and inexpensive drugs from Canada, which would have cut 40 to 60 percent off of the cost? . Mr. Gibson. Senator, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. Next question is for Senator Kerry, and this comes from Norma- Jean Laurent. Tort Reform Norma- Jean Laurent. Senator Kerry, you\\'ve stated your concern for the rising cost of health care. Yet you chose a Vice Presidential candidate who has made millions of dollars successfully suing medical professionals. How do you reconcile this with the voters? . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, we got several questions along this line, and I\\'m just curious if you\\'d go further on what you talked about with tort reform. Would you be favoring capping awards on pain and suffering? Would you limit attorneys\\' feesâ€” yes, to follow up on this for a minute. Thirty seconds. . Mr. Gibson. We\\'ll get to that in just a minute. Thirty seconds. . Mr. Gibson. The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Matthew O\\'Brien. Federal Deficit Matthew O\\'Brien. Mr. President, you have enjoyed a Republican majority in the House and Senate for most of your Presidency. In that time, you\\'ve not vetoed a single spending bill. Excluding 120 billion spent in Iran and Afghanâ€”I\\'m sorry, Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been $700 billion spent and not paid for by taxes. Please explain how the spending you have approved and not paid for is better for the American people than the spending proposed by your opponent. . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. I bothâ€”I heard you both sayâ€”I have heard you both say during the campaign, and I just heard you say itâ€” that you\\'re going to cut the deficit by a half in 4 years. But I didn\\'t hear one thing in the last 3 1/2 minutes that would indicate how either one of you do that. . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, the next question will be for you, and it comes from James Varner, who I believe is in this section. Mr. Varner? You need a microphone. Taxes James Varner. Thank you. Senator Kerry, would you be willing to look directly into the camera and, using simple and unequivocal language, give the American people your solemn pledge not to sign any legislation that will increase the tax burden on families earning less than $200,000 a year during your first term? . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, 90 seconds. . Mr. Gibson. No, you can keep going. . Mr. Gibson. You\\'re onâ€”â€” . Mr. Gibson. I\\'m going to come back one more time to how these numbers add up and how you can cut that deficit in half in 4 years, given what you\\'ve both said. . Mr. Gibson. Thirty secondsâ€”I\\'m sorry, thirty seconds, Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, the next question is for you, and it comes from James Hubb, over here. Action on the Environment/Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change James Hubb. Mr. President, how would you rate yourself as an environmentalist? What specifically has your administration done to improve the condition of our Nation\\'s air and water supply? . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President? . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, the next question is for you. It involves jobs, which is a topic in the news today. And for the question, we\\'re going to turn to Jane Barrow. Trade Competitiveness/Jobs/Taxes Jane Barrow. Senator Kerry, how can the U. S. be competitive in a manufacturing givenâ€”in manufacturing, excuse me, given the wage necessary and comfortably accepted for American workers to maintain the standard of living that they expect? . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Senator, I want to extend for a minute. You talk about tax credits to stop outsourcing. But when you have IBM documents that I saw recently, where you can hire a programmer for $12 in China, $56 an hour here, tax credits won\\'t cut it in that area. . Mr. Gibson. President Bush, the next question is for you, and it comes from Rob Fowler, who I believe is over in this area. PATRIOT Act Rob Fowler. President Bush, 45 days after 9/11, Congress passed the PATRIOT Act, which takes away checks on law enforcement and weakens American citizens\\' rights and freedoms, especially Fourth Amendment rights. With expansions of the PATRIOT Act and PATRIOT Act II, my question to you is, why are my rights being watered down and my citizens around me, and what are the specific justifications for these reforms? . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, the next question is for you, and it comes from Elizabeth Long. Embryonic Stem Cell Research Elizabeth Long. Senator Kerry, thousands of people have already been cured or treated by the use of adult stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells. However, no one has been cured by using embryonic stem cells. Wouldn\\'t it be wise to use stem cells obtained without the destruction of an embryo? . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Senator, thirty seconds, let\\'s extend. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, the next question is for you, and it comes from Jonathan Michaelson. Supreme Court Jonathan Michaelson. Mr. President, if there were a vacancy in the Supreme Court and you had the opportunity to fill that position today, who would you choose, and why? . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Going to go to the final two questions, now. And the first one will be for Senator Kerry, and this comes from Sarah Degenhart. Federal Funding of Abortions Sarah Degenhart. Senator Kerry, suppose you are speaking with a voter who believed abortion is murder, and the voter asked for reassurance that his or her tax dollars would not go to support abortion. What would you say to that person? . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Senator, do you want to follow up? Thirty seconds. . Mr. Gibson. And 30 seconds, Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. And the final question of the evening will be addressed to President Bush, and it will come from Linda Grabel. Linda Grabel is over here. . Mr. Gibson. I got faked out, myself. [Laughter] Presidential Decisionmaking/Funding U. S. Troops Linda Grabel. President Bush, during the last 4 years, you have made thousands of decisions that have affected millions of lives. Please give three instances in which you came to realize you had made a wrong decision, and what you did to correct it. Thank you. . Mr. Gibson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President. . Mr. Gibson. And Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. . Mr. Gibson. That\\'s going to conclude the questioning. We\\'re going to go now to closing statements, 2 minutes from each candidate. And the first closing statement goes to . Mr. Gibson. Senator. And a closing statement from . Mr. Gibson. Mr. President and .', 'EDWARDS': ' : This is a place where I believe I can and should win. . : I believe I\\'m going to win and I believe I\\'m going to go forward. And if I can just add to something that Senator Kerry just said. You know, I think it\\'s an enormous mistake, first historically, for us to ignore the South. What has happened is that the Republicans take the South for granted. And too many times, the Democrats ignore the South. We can\\'t do that, because historically we\\'ve never elected a Democrat president without winning at least five southern states. More importantly, it\\'s wrong because we as Democrats are about expanding the party, bringing people into the party. I mean we don\\'t - -  we reach out to everybody, everybody of different race, different gender, different background. And that also goes for those people who live in different regions of the country. So it\\'s enormously important for us to be successful, electorally, and to have a president that people in the South and all across the country believe represents them, represents their values, for us to continue that expansion and reach out and embrace the South. . : Well, it wasn\\'t just the National Intelligence Estimate, it was a whole - -  it was actually two or three years of sitting in briefings and receiving information from the Intelligence Committee, not only about the weapons issue, which is what Howard just talked about, but also about the atrocities that Saddam was committing against his own people, gassing Kurdish children in northern Iraq. And I have to say, I think it is not for the administration to get to the bottom of this. It\\'s actually not for the Congress to get to the bottom of this. The American people, we, need to get to the bottom of this, with an independent commission that looks at - -  that will have credibility and that the American people will trust, about why there is this discrepancy about what we were told and what\\'s actually been found there. . : I think the answer is no, we don\\'t get enough help in a lot of areas. For example, the Saudi royals, who we\\'re so dependent on Saudi Arabia for our oil, and we\\'ve not moved this country in the direction we need to go toward energy independence, which is desperately needed; cleaner, alternative sources of energy, more fuel- efficient vehicles, because we\\'re so dependent on them for oil, the fact we don\\'t get the cooperation we need from them. And there\\'s a complete disconnect between the leadership, not only in Saudi Arabia, but in a number of these Islamic countries and their people and their attitudes toward America. Can I just go back a moment ago - -  to a question you asked just a moment ago? You asked, I believe, Senator Kerry earlier whether there\\'s an exaggeration of the threat of the war on terrorism. It\\'s just hard for me to see how you can say there\\'s an exaggeration when thousands of people lost their lives on September the 11th. I think the problem here is the administration is not doing the things, number one, that need to be done to keep this country safe, both here and abroad. And number two, the president actually has to be able to do two things at once. This president thinks his presidency is only about the war on terrorism, only about national security. Those things are critical for a commander in chief. The president of the United States has to actually be able to walk and chew chewing gum at the same time, has to be able to do two things at the same time. (APPLAUSE) . : No, it\\'s not the truth. We can have a real impact on the loss of jobs. We can do something to bring jobs back to replace the jobs that we\\'ve lost. But we can\\'t stop it entirely. What John just said about that\\'s exactly right. But I want to say that this personal to me. You know, 40 miles from here, when I was born 50 years ago, my parents brought me home to a mill village, to a textile mill village. I have seen this my entire life growing up. I\\'ve seen mills close, I\\'ve seen what it does to communities, I\\'ve seen what it does to families. And all this talk among politicians in Washington about, \"We\\'re going to get you job retraining program, we\\'re going to make sure that we give you the transportation to get to a new job,\" say that to a 50-  or 55- year- old man who\\'s been supporting his family his entire life working in a mill. I think the truth of the matter is, we need to start by recognizing the pain. And not just the economic pain - -  the pain that these families are in. I mean, we have to fight hard to protect our jobs better for some of the reasons others have already talked about. We need to close loopholes in our tax code to give breaks to companies that are leaving, give tax breaks to American companies that will keep jobs here. . : The answer is, we have the best legal system in the world, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect. And we can make it work better. And if I can just piggyback on a couple of things that were said earlier. Governor Dean was critical of Senator Kerry for all the time he had been in Washington in the Senate and what had happened. Here is what I have proposed to deal with what I think is a serious problem with health care providers who are really getting squeezed on both sides, Tom. On one side, they have trouble getting reimbursed by HMOs, insurance companies, the government in some cases. And on the flip side, their costs are going up because the malpractice premiums are going up. What we should do is put a system in place - -  and this is a new idea - -  to keep cases that don\\'t belong in the system out of the system. And I would actually - -  you mentioned I was a lawyer, it\\'s true. I would actually put the responsibility on the lawyers. Require the lawyers to have these cases investigated and reviewed by independent experts to determine that they\\'re serious and that they\\'re meritorious. Require the lawyer to certify that before the case can even be brought into the legal system. And hold the lawyer accountable. And if they violate that rule three times, there\\'s a \"three strikes and you\\'re out\" provision so they lose the right to file these cases for a period of time. But the basic idea is, let\\'s keep cases out of the system that don\\'t belong in the system that are driving up costs. . : Because there are a whole group of issues, Tom, on which we can move the country forward, the president can move the country forward. For example, the recognition of partnership benefits, changing our immigration and adoption laws, so that they provide equality to gay and lesbian couples, a re- examination of the \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell\" policy with our military leadership. There are fundamental things that we still haven\\'t done, like passing of the Employment Non- Discrimination Act that would forever bar discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation. The same thing\\'s true about hate crimes legislation that would make gays and lesbians a protected class. There are enormous strides - -  I see your hand sticking out, I\\'ll stop - -  but there are enormous strides, enormous strides that can be made in America, and as president, I will move us forward dramatically on these issues. . : Thank you. Thank you, Gwen, for moderating this debate. Thank you to the folks of Case Western and all the people in Ohio for having us here. Mr. Vice President, you are still not being straight with the American people. I mean, the reality you and George Bush continue to tell people, first, that things are going well in Iraq - -  the American people don\\'t need us to explain this to them, they see it on their television every single day. We lost more troops in September than we lost in August; lost more in August than we lost in July; lost more in July than we lost in June. The truth is, our men and women in uniform have been heroic. Our military has done everything they\\'ve been asked to do. And it\\'s not just me that sees the mess in Iraq. There are Republican leaders, like John McCain, like Richard Lugar, like Chuck Hagel, who have said Iraq is a mess and it\\'s getting worse. And when they were asked why, Richard Lugar said because of the incompetence of the administration. What Paul Bremer said yesterday is they didn\\'t have enough troops to secure the country. They also didn\\'t have a plan to win the peace. They also didn\\'t put the alliances together to make this successful. We need a fresh start. We need a president who will speed up the training of the Iraqis, get more staff in for doing that. We need to speed up the reconstruction so the Iraqis see some tangible benefit. We need a new president who has the credibility, which John Kerry has, to bring others into this effort. . : Yes. Mr. Vice President, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein. The 9/11 Commission has said it. Your own secretary of state has said it. And you\\'ve gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection. There is not. And in fact the CIA is now about to report that the connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein is tenuous at best. And, in fact, the secretary of defense said yesterday that he knows of no hard evidence of the connection. We need to be straight with the American people. . : Here\\'s what it means: It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted. John Kerry and I have consistently said that. That\\'s why we voted for the resolution. But it also means it needed to be done the right way. And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn\\'t take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th. Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do. That was the right decision. And our military performed terrifically there. But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora. We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available. We had the finest military in the world on the ground. And what did we do? We turned - -  this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history. And what did the administration decide to do? They gave the responsibility of capturing and/or killing Saddam - -  I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden. Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden. We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq. And these connections - -  I want the American people to hear this very clearly. Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying. Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th - -  period. The 9/11 Commission has said that\\'s true. Colin Powell has said it\\'s true. But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is. There is not. And, in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best. . : Someone did get it wrong. But it wasn\\'t John Kerry and John Edwards. They got it wrong. When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords. They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large. Now, I want to go back to something the vice president said just a minute ago, because these distortions are continuing. He said that - -  made mention of this global test. What John Kerry said - -  and it\\'s just as clear as day to anybody who was listening - -  he said: We will find terrorists where they are and kill them before they ever do harm to the American people, first. We will keep this country safe. He defended this country as a young man, he will defend this country as president of the United States. He also said very clearly that he will never give any country veto power over the security of the United States of America. Now, I know the vice president would like to pretend that wasn\\'t said, and the president would too. But the reality is it was said. Here\\'s what\\'s actually happened in Afghanistan, regardless of this rosy scenario that they paint on Afghanistan, just like they do with Iraq. What\\'s actually happened is they\\'re now providing 75 percent of the world\\'s opium. Not only are they providing 75 percent of the world\\'s opium, large- cut parts of the country are under the control of drug lords and warlords. Big parts of the country are still insecure. And the reality is the part of Afghanistan, eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is, is one of the hardest places to control and the most insecure, Gwen. . : The vice president just said that we should focus on state sponsors of terrorism. Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program. They\\'re more dangerous today than they were four years ago. North Korea has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program, gone from one to two nuclear weapons to six to eight nuclear weapons. This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet. It\\'s a mistake. We should not only not lift them, we should strengthen those sanctions. . : Sure. . : Well, let me say, first, he said in the same segment - -  I don\\'t remember precisely where it was connected with what you just read - -  but he said, point blank, \"We will never give anyone a veto over the security of the United States of America. \"What he\\'s saying is we\\'re going to go back to the proud tradition of the United States of America and presidents of the United States of America for the last 50 to 75 years. First, we\\'re going to actually tell the American people the truth. We\\'re going to tell them the truth about what\\'s happening. We\\'re not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, they\\'re not. We\\'re going to make sure that the American people know the truth about why we are using force and what the explanation for it is. And it\\'s not just the American people. We\\'re also going to make sure that we tell the world the truth. Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it\\'s done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible. It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what we\\'re doing, what we say, what we say at the United Nations, what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world - -  of other countries. They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good, because they will not follow us without that. And unfortunately, we\\'re seeing the consequences of that right now. It\\'s one of the reasons that we\\'re having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq. You know, we\\'ve taken 90 percent of the coalition causalities. American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq. And we see the result of there not being a coalition: The first Gulf war cost America $5 billion. We\\'re at $200 billion and counting. John Kerry will never give up control over the security of the United States of America to any other country. We will not outsource our responsibility to keep this country safe. . : May I respond briefly? What the vice president has just said is just a complete distortion. The American people saw John Kerry on Thursday night. They don\\'t need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw. They saw a man who was strong, who had conviction, who is resolute, who made it very clear that he will do everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe. He laid out his plan for success in Iraq, made it clear that we were committed to success in Iraq. We have to be, because we have troops on the ground there and because they have created a haven for terrorists. . : Thank you. One thing that\\'s very clear is that a long resume does not equal good judgment. I mean, we\\'ve seen over and over and over the misjudgments made by this administration. I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because it\\'s a continuation of the things he\\'s been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; it\\'s a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight. John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country\\'s history. John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country\\'s history. This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he\\'s criticizing John Kerry for voting against. These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War. The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led. On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace. We\\'re seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now. We stood up and said: For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace. We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7. 5 billion was going to go to a no- bid contract for Halliburton, the vice president\\'s former company. It was wrong then. It\\'s wrong now. . : John Kerry has been absolutely clear and consistent from the beginning that we must stay focused on the people who attacked us; that Saddam Hussein was a threat that needed to be addressed directly; that the weapons inspectors needed to have time to do their job. Had they had time to do their job, they would have discovered what we now know, that in fact Saddam Hussein had no weapons, that in fact Saddam Hussein has no connection with 9/11, that in fact Saddam Hussein has little or no connection with Al Qaida. . : Well, let\\'s start with what we know. What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need - -  dramatically different than the first Gulf War. We know that they haven\\'t done it, and we know they can\\'t do it. They didn\\'t, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead-  up to the war. They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences. What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq - -  and we have a plan for Iraq. They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same. We have a plan for success. And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training. Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what\\'s happening. And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them. It is not secure enough. It\\'s so dangerous on the ground that they can\\'t be trained there. We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process. That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time. Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there. Now, that\\'s compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground. You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq. And they keep saying the election\\'s on schedule, this is going to happen. The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success. Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition. Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said. He attacks us about the troops. They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed. While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay. This is the height of hypocrisy. . : Thank you. The vice president suggests that we have the same number of countries involved now that we had in the first Gulf War. The first Gulf War cost the American people $5 billion. And regardless of what the vice president says, we\\'re at $200 billion and counting. Not only that, 90 percent of the coalition casualties, Mr. Vice President, the coalition casualties, are American casualties. Ninety percent of the cost of this effort are being borne by American taxpayers. It is the direct result of the failures of this administration. . : Oh, I\\'m not. . . . : I\\'m not demeaning. . . . : No, sir, I did not. . . . : Thanks. . : Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I\\'ll answer that question. This, unfortunately - -  what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day. It\\'s a continuation of, \"Well, there\\'s a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein. \"It\\'s not true. It\\'s a continuation of at least insinuating that there\\'s some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein. It\\'s not true. It\\'s saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day - -  Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents. The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term. You know, remember \"shock and awe\"? Look at where we are now. It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort. This is not an accident. Now, let me go back to your question. If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can\\'t be dragged kicking and screaming to it. One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things. But what\\'s happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do. They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it. We can\\'t react that way. We must be more aggressive. With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission, so that we have the information we need to find terrorists and crush them before hey hurt us. . : Well, the vice president talks about there being a member, or someone associated with Al Qaida, in Iraq. There are 60 countries who have members of Al Qaida in them. How many of those countries are we going to invade? Not only that, he talks about Iran. The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch. They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans. Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq. John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran. I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question. This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton. Here\\'s why we didn\\'t think Halliburton should have a no- bid contract. While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States. They\\'re now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time. Not only that, they\\'ve gotten a $7. 5 billion no- bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it\\'s normally done, because they\\'re under investigation, they\\'ve continued to get their money. . : These are the facts. The facts are the vice president\\'s company that he was CEO of, that did business with sworn enemies of the United States, paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false financial information, it\\'s under investigation for bribing foreign officials. The same company that got a $7. 5 billion no- bid contract, the rule is that part of their money is supposed to be withheld when they\\'re under investigation, as they are now, for having overcharged the American taxpayer, but they\\'re getting every dime of their money. I\\'m happy to let voters make their own decision about this. . : Well, first of all, I do agree that we\\'ve been largely absent, not entirely absent, but largely absent from the peace- making process over the last four years. And let me just say a couple of preliminary things and then talk about where we are now. First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves. They have an obligation to defend themselves. I mean, if I can, just for a moment, tell you a personal story. I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel. We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed. Six children were killed. What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists? They have not only the right to the obligation to defend themselves. Now, we know that the prime minister has made a decision, an historic decision, to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza. It\\'s important for America to participate in helping with that process. Now, if Gaza\\'s being used as a platform for attacking the Israeli people, that has to be stopped. And Israel has a right to defend itself. They don\\'t have a partner for peace right now. They certainly don\\'t have a partner in Arafat, and they need a legitimate partner for peace. And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9/11. And it\\'s important for America to confront the situation in Iran, because Iran is an enormous threat to Israel and to the Israeli people. . : That was a complete distortion of my record. I know that won\\'t come as a shock. The vice president, I\\'m surprised to hear him talk about records. When he was one of 435 members of the United States House, he was one of 10 to vote against Head Start, one of four to vote against banning plastic weapons that can pass through metal detectors. He voted against the Department of Education. He voted against funding for Meals on Wheels for seniors. He voted against a holiday for Martin Luther King. He voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa. It\\'s amazing to hear him criticize either my record or John Kerry\\'s. . : No, I did talk about it, Israel. He\\'s the one who didn\\'t talk about it. . : Gwen, your question was about jobs? . : I thought it was about jobs and poverty. I hope we get a chance to talk about education, but that\\'s what the vice president talked about. Here\\'s what\\'s happened: In the time that they have been in office, in the last four years, 1. 6 million private sector jobs have been lost, 2. 7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. And it\\'s had real consequences in places like Cleveland. Cleveland is a wonderful, distinguished city that\\'s done a lot of great things, but it has the highest poverty rate in the country. One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty. During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty. During the time that the vice president and the president have been in office, 4 million more Americans have fallen into poverty. And what the most striking and startling thing is, they are the first presidency in 70 years - -  and I\\'m talking Democrats, Republican, presidents who led us through World War, through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Cold War - -  every one of them created jobs until this president. We have to do better. We have a plan. We\\'re going to get rid of - -  by the way, they\\'re for outsourcing jobs. I want to make sure people hear that, the fundamental difference with us. The administration says over and over that the outsourcing of millions of American jobs is good. We\\'re against it. We want to get rid of tax cuts for companies sending jobs overseas. We want to balance this budget, get back to fiscal responsibility. And we want to invest in the creative, innovative jobs of the future. . : The vice president and president like to talk about their experience on the campaign trail. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Millions have fallen into poverty. Family incomes are down, while the cost of everything is going up. Medical costs are up the highest they\\'ve ever been over the last four years. We have this mess in Iraq. Mr. Vice President, I don\\'t think the country can take four more years of this kind of experience. . : Because we will do what they\\'ve not done. You know, if you look at what\\'s happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit. They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security. Not done. Not only that, it\\'s the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history. And there\\'s no end in sight. The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they\\'re going to do about it. John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren. So here\\'s what we\\'re going to do, to answer you question. To pay for the things that we believe need to be done - -  and I hope to get the chance to talk about health care and also about education, because we have plans on both of those subjects - -  what we\\'re going to do is roll back tax cuts. And I want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail: Roll back tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year; we will do that. We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle- class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care. These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief. But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington. One of the amazing things that\\'s happened is they\\'ve actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government. We also want to close some corporate loopholes. Now, I want to be honest with people. We can\\'t eliminate this deficit. People have heard that over and over and over in four years. We cannot do it. We\\'re in too deep a hole. But we can cut the deficit in half. And if we move, we can move this country back on a path to fiscal responsibility. . : We are committed to cutting back anything in our programs that need to be cut back to get us back on a path to fiscal responsibility. John Kerry, Mr. Vice President, has voted or co- sponsored over 600 times tax cuts for the American people - -  over 600 times. And there is a philosophical difference between us and them. We are for more tax cuts for the middle class than they\\'re for, have been for the last four years. But we are not for more tax cuts for multimillionaires. They are. And it is a fundamental difference in what we think needs to be done in this country. . : Yes. Let me say first, on an issue that the vice president said in his last answer before we got to this question, talking about tax policy, the country needs to know that under what they have put in place and want to put in place, a millionaire sitting by their swimming pool, collecting their statements to see how much money they\\'re making, make their money from dividends, pays a lower tax rate than the men and women who are receiving paychecks for serving on the ground in Iraq. Now, they may think that\\'s right. John Kerry and I do not. We don\\'t just value wealth, which they do. We value work in this country. And it is a fundamental value difference between them and us. Now, as to this question, let me say first that I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter. I think they love her very much. And you can\\'t have anything but respect for the fact that they\\'re willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her. It\\'s a wonderful thing. And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy. And I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and so does John Kerry. I also believe that there should be partnership benefits for gay and lesbian couples in long- term, committed relationships. But we should not use the Constitution to divide this country. No state for the last 200 years has ever had to recognize another state\\'s marriage. This is using the Constitution as a political tool, and it\\'s wrong. . : No. I think we\\'ve both said the same thing all along. We both believe that - -  and this goes onto the end of what I just talked about - -  we both believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long- term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits. For example, a gay couple now has a very difficult time, one, visiting the other when they\\'re in the hospital, or, for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral. I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in. I suspect the vice president himself does not believe in that. But we don\\'t - -  we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. And I want to go back, if I can, to the question you just asked, which is this constitutional amendment. I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary. Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another state\\'s marriage. Let me just be simple about this. My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about. There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment. It\\'s nothing but a political tool. And it\\'s being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on. We ought to be talking about issues like health care and jobs and what\\'s happening in Iraq, not using an issue to divide this country in a way that\\'s solely for political purposes. It\\'s wrong. . : Yes. Well let me say, first of all, I\\'m proud of the work I did on behalf of kids and families against big insurance companies, big drug companies and big HMOs. We do have too many lawsuits. And the reality is there\\'s something that we can do about it. John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it. We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don\\'t do it; have a three- strikes- and- you\\'re- out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases. That way we keep the cases out of the system that don\\'t belong in the system. They talk about frivolous cases. We believe cases that don\\'t belong in the system should never be in the system. But we don\\'t believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover. It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem. They hid it. They didn\\'t tell anybody. They could have fixed it with a 2- cent screw. That\\'s wrong. John Kerry and I are always going to stand with the Valerie Lakeys of the world, and not with the insurance companies. . : Am I personally attacked? I think the truth is that what they\\'re doing is talking about an issue that really doesn\\'t have a great deal to do with what\\'s happening with medical policy in this country, which I think is a very serious issue. And I would be the first to say that what the vice president described a few minutes ago, problems with malpractice premiums, that\\'s true, it\\'s real. It\\'s very real. What doctors talk about is very serious. And they\\'re getting squeezed from both sides. I mean, because, they have trouble getting reimbursed, first of all, for the care that they provide, you know, from the government or from health- care companies. And, on the flip side, their malpractice costs are going up. That\\'s very real, which is why we have proposed a plan to keep cases out of the system that don\\'t belong there. But it\\'s very important to put this in context. Because, in context, everything they\\'re proposing, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, amounts to about half of 1 percent of health- care costs in this country - -  half of 1 percent. We have double- digit inflation in health care costs. We\\'ve seen the largest rise in medical costs in the last four years in the country\\'s history: $3,500 nationally. And nobody who\\'s watching this debate needs me to explain this to them. They know it. Medicare premiums are up 17 percent on their watch. Again, largest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of Medicare. We think we have a plan to keep cases that don\\'t belong in the system out, but we also do what they haven\\'t done. Five million Americans have lost their health care coverage. Medical costs are skyrocketing. We have a serious health care plan to bring down costs for everybody, to cover millions more Americans and to actually stand up to drug companies and insurance companies which this administration has been unwilling to do. . : Well, first of all, I have paid all the taxes that I owe. When the vice president was CEO of Halliburton, they took advantage of every offshore loophole available. They had multiple offshore companies that were avoiding taxes. Those are the kind of things that ought to be closed. They ought to be closed. They ought to be closed for anybody. They ought to be closed whether they\\'re personal, and they ought to be closed whether they apply to a corporation. But the reality is health care costs are going up every day for the American people, and I hope we\\'re going to get a chance to talk more about health care. . : Well, first, with respect to what\\'s happening in Africa and Russia and in other places around the world, the vice president spoke about the $15 billion for AIDS. John Kerry and I believe that needs to be doubled. And I might add, on the first year of their commitment, they came up significantly short of what they had promised. And we probably won\\'t get a chance to talk about Africa. Let me just say a couple of things. The AIDS epidemic in Africa, which is killing millions and millions of people and is a frightening thing not just for the people of Africa but also for the rest of the world, that, combined with the genocide that we\\'re now seeing in Sudan, are two huge moral issues for the United States of America, which John Kerry spoke about eloquently last Thursday night. Here at home we need to do much more. And the vice president spoke about doing research, making sure we have the drugs available, making sure that we do everything possible to have prevention. But it\\'s a bigger question than that. You know, we have 5 million Americans who\\'ve lost their health care coverage in the last four years; 45 million Americans without health care coverage. We have children who don\\'t have health care coverage. If kids and adults don\\'t have access to preventative care, if they\\'re not getting the health care that they need day after day after day, the possibility of not only developing AIDS and having a problem - -  having a problem - -  a life- threatening problem, but the problem of developing other life- threatening diseases is there every day of their lives. . : The American people want in their president and in their vice president basically three things: They want to know that their president and their vice president will keep them safe. They want to know that they have good judgment. And they want to know that you\\'ll tell them the truth. John Kerry and I will tell the American people the truth. During the time that I have served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, traveling to some of the places we\\'ve talked about tonight - -  Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, Turkey - -  meeting with the leaders of NATO, I have a very clear idea of what has to be done to keep this country safe. The threats we face: terrorism, killing terrorists and stopping them before they can do damage to us, making sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapons. I agree with John Kerry from Thursday night, that the danger of nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorists is one of the greatest threats that America faces. But the one thing that we know from this administration is - -  and I - -  first of all, I don\\'t claim to have the long political resume that Vice President Cheney has. That\\'s just the truth, and the American people know that and deserve to know it. But what we know from this administration is that a long resume does not equal good judgment. Here are the judgments I would make: My first priority would be to keep this country safe. I would find terrorists where they are and stop them and kill them before they do harm to us. We would stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And we would also strengthen this military, which means providing the equipment and training that they need. We want to raise the active- duty forces by 40,000, double the special forces so we can find terrorists where they are, and provide the kind of support for families - -  health care, housing - -  that they deserve while their loved ones are serving and protecting us. . : I think the most important thing I\\'ve learned from this process is what I now know about John Kerry. I knew him before. I know him better now. He\\'s the one candidate who\\'s led troops in battle. He was a prosecutor, putting people behind bars to protect neighborhoods from crime. He fought for 100,000 cops on the street, and went with John McCain to Vietnam to find out what happened to our POWs. And the American people saw for themselves on Thursday night the strength, resolve, and backbone that I, myself, have seen in John Kerry. He is ready to be commander in chief. . : Mr. Vice President, we were attacked. But we weren\\'t attacked by Saddam Hussein. And one thing that John Kerry and I would agree with you about is that it is. . . . : Oh, I\\'m sorry. I broke the rule. One thing that we agree about is the need to be offensive in going after terrorists. The reality is that the best defense is a good offense, which means leading - -  America returning to its proud tradition of the last 75 years, of once again leading strong coalitions so we can get at these terrorist cells where they are, before they can do damage to us and to the American people. John Kerry made clear on Thursday night that - -  I\\'m sorry, I broke the rules. We made clear - -  we made clear on Thursday night that we will do that, and we will do it aggressively. But there are things that need to be done to keep this country safe that have not yet been done. For example, three years after 9/11, we find out that the administration still does not have a unified terrorist watch list. It\\'s amazing. Three years. What are we waiting for? You know, we still don\\'t have one list that everyone can work off of to see if terrorists are entering this country. We\\'re screening our passengers going onto airplanes, but we don\\'t screen the cargo. There are so many things that could be done to keep this country safe. You have to be strong, and you have to be aggressive. But we also have to be smart. And there are things that have not been done that need to be done to keep the American people safe. . : Well, first of all, let me say that John Kerry has - -  I can use his name now? . : OK. John Kerry has been, as have I, been completely consistent about Iraq. We\\'ve made very clear from the beginning - -  and not an afterthought; we said it at the time - -  that we had to confront Saddam Hussein and that we had to have a coalition and a plan to be successful. And the vice president didn\\'t say much about it in your earlier question, but Paul Bremer has now made clear that they didn\\'t have enough troops and they didn\\'t have a plan. And the American people are seeing the results of that every single day, in spite of the proud and courageous service of our men and women in uniform. Now, flip- flops: They should know something about flip- flops. They\\'ve seen a lot of it during their administration. They were first against the 9/11 Commission; then they were for it. They were for a department of homeland security - -  I mean, they were against the Department of Homeland Security; then they were for it. They said they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus when they came into office aside to protect Social Security; then they changed their minds. They said that they supported the troops; and then while our troops were on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, they went to the Congress and lobbied to have their combat pay cut. They said that they were going to do something about health care in this country. And they\\'ve done something: They\\'ve made it worse. They said that they were going to fund their No Child Left Behind; $27 billion short today. Over and over, this administration has said one thing and done another. This president said - -  I listened to him the other night at his 2000 debate saying: I\\'m for a national patients bill of rights. I know something about this. John McCain and Senator Kennedy and I wrote it, got it passed in the Senate. We don\\'t have a patients bill of rights because of one man today, the president of the United States. They\\'ve gone back and forth. . : Yes, but they didn\\'t fund the mandates that they put on the schools all over this country. That\\'s the reason 800 teachers - -  one of the reasons - -  800 teachers have been laid off, right here in Cleveland. One- third of our public schools are failing under this administration. Half of African- Americans are dropping out of high school. Half of Hispanic- American are dropping out of high school. John and I have - -  and I don\\'t have the time now - -  but we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there. . : Are you sure - -  yes, he started. Yes, 30 seconds, please, yes. We are for accountability, and we are for high standards. John and I voted for No Child Left Behind because we thought that accountability and standards were the right thing to do. But they make - -  did you figure out you were wrong? . : Well, in fairness, if you feel like you need to go to him, we\\'ll - -  I\\'ll stop. . : Thank you. The president said that he would unite this country, that he was a uniter, not a divider. Have you ever seen America more divided? Have you ever seen Washington more divided? The reality is it is not an accident. It\\'s the direct result of the choices they\\'ve made and their efforts that have created division in America. We can do better than that in this country. Now I want to go back to the whole issue of health care, because we touched it, but I think the American people deserve to know what we would do different. I mean, 5 million people losing their health care - -  everyone who\\'s watching this knows health insurance premiums are through the roof. We need to talk about what we will do that they haven\\'t done. First, we\\'re going to make the same health care that\\'s available to members of Congress available to all Americans. We\\'re going to cover all kids. Not only that, we\\'re going to bring down costs by pooling the catastrophic costs so we bring down premiums. And we\\'re going to give tax breaks directly to families, save them up to $1,000 a year, and to businesses - -  the vice president talked about that a few minutes ago - -  so that they can provide health care to their employees. And we\\'re also going to finally do something about the cost of prescription drugs. They\\'ve blocked allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada. We\\'re going to allow it. They would not allow the government to use its negotiating power to get discounts for seniors. We\\'re going to allow it. We\\'re also going to stand up to the drug companies and do something about these drug company ads on television which are out of control. . : They had a choice on allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada, of being with the American people or with the drug companies. They were with the drug companies. They had a choice on negotiating discounts in the Medicare prescription drug bill of being with the American people or with the drug companies. They were with the drug companies. They had a choice on the patients\\' bill of rights, allowing people to make their own health care decisions and not having insurance companies make them, be with the American people, be with the big insurance companies. They\\'re with the insurance companies. John Kerry and I will always fight for the American people. . : Thank you. Thank you, Gwen. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here. You know, when I was young and growing up, I remember coming down the steps into the kitchen, early in the morning, and I would see the glow of the television. And I\\'d see my father sitting at a table. He wasn\\'t paying bills, and he wasn\\'t doing paperwork from work. What he was doing was learning math on television. Now, he didn\\'t have a college education, but he was doing what he could do to get a better job in the mill where he worked. I was proud of him. I\\'m still proud of him. And I was also hopeful, because I knew that I lived in a country where I could get a college education. Here\\'s the truth: I have grown up in the bright light of America. But that light is flickering today. Now, I know that the vice president and the president don\\'t see it, but you do. You see it when your incomes are going down and the cost of everything - -  college tuition, health care - -  is going through the roof. You see it when you sit at your table each night and there\\'s an empty chair because a loved one is serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. What they\\'re going to give you is four more years of the same. John Kerry and I believe that we can do better. We believe in a strong middle- class in this country. That\\'s why we have a plan to create jobs, getting rid of tax cuts for companies outsourcing your jobs; give tax cuts to companies that\\'ll keep jobs here in America. That\\'s why we have a health care plan. That\\'s why we have a plan to keep you safe and to fix this mess in Iraq. The truth is that every four years you get to decide. You have the ability to decide where America\\'s going to go. John Kerry and I are asking you to give us the power to fight for you, to fight to keep that dream in America, that I saw as a young man, alive for every parent sitting at that kitchen table. .', 'IFILL': ' : Good evening from Case Western Reserve University\\'s Veale Center here in Cleveland, Ohio. I\\'m Gwen Ifill of \"The NewsHour\" and \"Washington Week\" on PBS, and I welcome you to the first and the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Edwards, the Democratic nominee. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\\'s will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce the rules they have devised for themselves to the best of my ability. The questions tonight will be divided between foreign and domestic policy, but the specific topics were chosen by me. The candidates have not been told what they are. The rules: For each question, there can be only a two-  minute response, a 90- second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute. A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15 seconds, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means time\\'s up. There\\'s also a back- up buzzer system, if needed. Candidates may not direct questions to one another. There will be two- minute closing statements, but no opening statements. There is an audience here in the hall, but they have been instructed to remain silent throughout. The order of the first question was determined by the candidates in advance, and the first one goes to Vice President Cheney. Vice President Cheney, there have been new developments in Iraq, especially having to do with the administration\\'s handling. Paul Bremer, the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, gave a speech in which he said that we have never had enough troops on the ground, or we\\'ve never had enough troops on the ground. Donald Rumsfeld said he has not seen any hard evidence of a link between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein. Was this approved - -  of a report that you requested that you received a week ago that showed there was no connection between Abu Musab al- Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein? . : Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds to respond. . : You have 30 seconds to respond, Mr. Vice President. . : You have 30 seconds, Senator. . : Time for a new question but the same topic. And this time to you, Senator Edwards. You and Senator Kerry have said that the war in Iraq is the wrong war at the wrong time. Does that mean that if you had been president and vice president that Saddam Hussein would still be in power? . : Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds to respond. . : You will respond to that topic, but first I want to ask you for two minutes, Vice President Cheney. Tonight we mentioned Afghanistan. We believe that Osama bin Laden is hiding perhaps in a cave somewhere along the Afghan- Pakistan border. If you get a second term, what is your plan to capture him and then to neutralize those who have sprung up to replace him? . : Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds. . : Mr. Vice President, 30 seconds. . : New question to you, Senator Edwards, but I don\\'t want to let go of the global test question first, because. . . . : . . . I want people to understand exactly what it is, as you said, that Senator Kerry did say. He said, \"You\\'ve got to do\" - -  you know, he was asked about preemptive action at the last debate - -  he said, \"You\\'ve got to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you\\'re doing what you\\'re doing and can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons. \" What is a global test if it\\'s not a global veto? . : Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds to respond. . : Mr. Vice President, you have 30 seconds. . : Mr. Vice President, a new question for you. You have two minutes to respond. When the president says that Senator Kerry is emboldening enemies and you say that we could get hit again if voters make the wrong choice in November, are you saying that it would be a dangerous thing to have John Kerry as president? . : Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds to respond. . : Mr. Vice President, you have 30 seconds. . : And 30 seconds. . . . : Senator Edwards, new question to you, and you have two minutes to respond. Part of what you have said and Senator Kerry has said that you are going to do in order to get us out of the problems in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naive? . : Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds. . : Senator Edwards, 30 seconds. . : Mr. Vice President? . : New question, similar topic, because I want to circle back to a question which I\\'m not quite certain we got an answer to. But I will direct it to you first, Senator Edwards. . : It\\'s a question of American intelligence. If this report that we\\'ve read about today is true, and if Vice President Cheney ordered it and asked about this, do you think that, in the future, that your administration or the Bush administration would have sufficient and accurate enough intelligence to be able to make decisions about where to go next? . : Mr. Vice President? . : Mr. Vice President, in June of 2000 when you were still CEO of Halliburton, you said that U. S. businesses should be allowed to do business with Iran because, quote, \"Unilateral sanctions almost never work. \"After four years as vice president now, and with Iran having been declared by your administration as part of the \"Axis of Evil,\" do you still believe that we should lift sanctions on Iran? . : Senator Edwards? . : Mr. Vice President? . : Well, that\\'s all you\\'ve got. (LAUGHTER). : Thirty seconds. . : Senator Edwards, as we wrap up the foreign policy part of this, I do want to talk to you about the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. Today, a senior member of Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, targeted assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing at a time when the United States seems absent in the peace- making process. What would your administration do? First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don\\'t. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? . : Mr. Vice President, 90 seconds. . : Senator Edwards, it\\'s your turn to use 30 seconds for a complicated response. . . . : Thirty seconds. . : In that case, we\\'ll move on to domestic matters. And this question, I believe, goes to Senator - -  to Vice President Cheney. The Census Bureau. . . . : It goes to the Senator. I see you. I just asked him about Israel, even though we didn\\'t actually talk about it much. . : Mr. Vice President, the Census Bureau ranked Cleveland as the biggest poor city in the country, 31 percent jobless rate. You two gentlemen are pretty well off. You did well for yourselves in the private sector. What can you tell the people of Cleveland, or people of cities like Cleveland, that your administration will do to better their lives? . : Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds. . : It was about jobs, and it was about poverty. . : Mr. Vice President? . : Thirty seconds. . : This next question goes to you, Senator Edwards. Senator Kerry said in a recent interview that he absolutely will not raise taxes on anyone under - -  who earns under $200,000 a year. How can he guarantee that and also cut the deficit in half, as he\\'s promised? . : You have 90 seconds, Mr. Vice President. . : Thirty seconds, Senator Edwards. . : You have 30 seconds, Mr. Vice President. . : The next question goes to you, Mr. Vice President. I want to read something you said four years ago at this very setting: \"Freedom means freedom for everybody. \" You said it again recently when you were asked about legalizing same- sex unions. And you used your family\\'s experience as a context for your remarks. Can you describe then your administration\\'s support for a constitutional ban on same- sex unions? . : Senator Edwards, 90 seconds. . : New question, but same subject. As the vice president mentioned, John Kerry comes from the state of Massachusetts, which has taken as big a step as any state in the union to legalize gay marriage. Yet both you and Senator Kerry say you oppose it. Are you trying to have it both ways? . : Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds. . : That\\'s it? . : OK, then we\\'ll move on to the next question. This one is for you, Mr. Vice President. President Bush has derided in John Kerry for putting a trial lawyer on the ticket. You yourself have said that lawsuits are partly to blame for higher medical costs. Are you willing to say that John Edwards, sitting here, has been part of the problem? (LAUGHTER). : Mr. Vice President? (LAUGHTER) . : Senator Edwards? . : Senator Edwards, new question to you, same topic. Do you feel personally attacked when Vice President Cheney talks about liability reform and tort reform and the president talks about having a trial lawyer on the ticket? . : Mr. Vice President? . : You have 30 seconds to respond. . : Thirty seconds, Mr. Vice President. . : I will talk to you about health care, Mr. Vice President. You have two minutes. But in particular, I want to talk to you about AIDS, and not about AIDS in China or Africa, but AIDS right here in this country, where black women between the ages of 25 and 44 are 13 times more likely to die of the disease than their counterparts. What should the government\\'s role be in helping to end the growth of this epidemic? . : Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds. . : OK, we\\'ll move on. This goes to you, Senator Edwards, and you have two minutes. Ten men and women have been nominees of their parties since 1976 to be vice president. Out of those ten, you have the least governmental experience of any of them. What qualifies you to be a heartbeat away? . : Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds. . : That was the question. . : You have 30 seconds, if you\\'d like to respond to that. . : Mr. Vice President, you have 30 seconds to respond. . : Mr. Vice President, picking up on that, you both just sang the praises of the tops of your ticket. Without mentioning them by name at all, explain to us why you are different from your opponent, starting with you, Mr. Vice President. . : Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds. . : You just used John Kerry\\'s name. . : Would you like to respond? Thirty seconds. . : OK, we\\'ll move on. This goes to Senator Edwards. Flip- flopping has become a recurring theme in this campaign, you may have noticed. Senator Kerry changed his mind about whether to vote to authorize the president to go to war. President Bush changed his mind about whether a homeland security department was a good idea or a 9/11 Commission was a good idea. What\\'s wrong with a little flip- flop every now and then? . : Yes. . : Mr. Vice President? . : You have 30 seconds if you choose. . : Mr. Vice President? . : Mr. Vice President, our final - -  I\\'m sorry, you have 30 seconds, Senator Edwards. . : I did figure out I was wrong. . : Well, I do, because we\\'re actually on the final question. I apologize for giving you an extra 15 seconds there. I go now to Vice President Cheney. Whichever one of you is elected in November - -  you mentioned those three electoral votes in Wyoming and how critical they\\'ve turned out to be. But what they\\'re a sign of also is that you\\'re going to inherit a very deeply divided electorate, economically, politically, you name it. How will you set out, Mr. Vice President, in a way that you weren\\'t able to in these past four years, to bridge that divide? . : Senator, there\\'s 90 seconds. . : You have 30 seconds to respond to that, Mr. Vice President. . : Thirty seconds. . : As previously agreed, we\\'ll go to closing statements now, two minutes each. Coin toss, Senator Edwards, you begin. . : Vice President Cheney? . : And with that, we come to the end of tonight\\'s debate. On behalf of the commission and the candidates, I\\'d like to extend a special thank you to the students and administration here at Case Western Reserve University. A reminder: The second presidential debate takes place this coming Friday at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Charles Gibson of ABC News will serve as moderator of that encounter, where the candidates will field questions from an audience. Then, on October 13th, from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, Bob Schieffer of CBS News will moderate a debate on domestic issues. For now, thank you, Vice President Cheney, Senator Edwards. From Cleveland, Ohio, I\\'m Gwen Ifill. Thank you, and goodnight.

Bob, thank you very much. I want to thank Arizona State as well. Yes, we can be safe and secure if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world. I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down Al Qaida, wherever it existsâ€”and we\\'re making progress; three- quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justiceâ€”but to make sure that countries who harbor terrorists are held to account. As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19- year- old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march. We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein. In other words, in order to make sure we\\'re secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent, just this weekend, talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a \"nuisance,\" comparing it to prostitution and illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don\\'t think you can secure America for the long run if you don\\'t have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people. At home, we\\'ll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it. We\\'re doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports. But absolutely, we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership. . President Bush. Gosh, I don\\'t think I ever said I\\'m not worried about Usama bin Laden. That\\'s kind of one of those exaggerations. Of course, we\\'re worried about Usama bin Laden. We\\'re on the hunt after Usama bin Laden. We\\'re using every asset at our disposal to get Usama bin Laden. My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this is aâ€”war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected. Flu Vaccine Shortage/Health Care . President Bush. Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn\\'t allow contaminated medicine into our country. We\\'re working with Canada to, hopefullyâ€”that they\\'ll produce aâ€”help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season. My call to our fellow Americans is, if you\\'re healthy, if you\\'re younger, don\\'t get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young. The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly. I haven\\'t gotten a flu shot, and I don\\'t intend to, because I want to make sure that those who are most vulnerable get treated. We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and so, therefore, they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine. One of the reasons I\\'m such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren\\'t afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law. But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England, is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don\\'t get a flu shot. . President Bush. This President has turned his back on the wellness of America, and there is no system. In fact, it\\'s starting to fall apart, not because of lawsuitsâ€”though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing themâ€”but because of the larger issue that we don\\'t cover Americans. Children across our country don\\'t have health care. We\\'re the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. I have a plan to cover all Americans. We\\'re going to make it affordable and accessible. We\\'re going to let everybody buy into the same health care plan the Senators and Congressmen give themselves. . President Bush. I would, thank you. I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can\\'t pay for. He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy into the same plan that Senators and Congressman get. That costs the Government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up like the Senator suggested, it would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. It\\'s an empty promise. It\\'s called bait and switch. . President Bush. Thank you. . President Bush. Well, his rhetoric doesn\\'t match his record. He\\'s been a Senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative or fiscally sound, but he voted overâ€”he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. 2 trillion. He talks about pay- goâ€”I\\'ll tell you what pay- go means when you\\'re a Senator from Massachusetts, when you\\'re a colleague of Ted Kennedy: Pay- go means you pay, and he goes ahead and spends. He\\'s proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so- called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small- business owners in America, raises 600 million by our accountâ€”billionâ€”800 billion by his account. There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class. I proposed a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, \"Here\\'s how we\\'re going to reduce the deficit in half by 5 years. \" It requires pro- growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the Halls of Congress. Jobs/Education . President Bush. I say, Bob, \"I\\'ve got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century, and here\\'s some help for you to go get an education. Here\\'s some help for you to go to a community college. We\\'ve expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. \" You know, there\\'s a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing, and we talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. And so we said, \"Let\\'s raise the standards. We\\'re spending more money, but let\\'s raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it\\'s too late. \" You know, education is how to help the person who has lost a job. Education is how to make sure thisâ€”we\\'ve got a workforce that\\'s productive and competitive. You gotâ€”4 more years, I\\'ve got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell grants, to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. And so to the person you talked to, I say, \"Here\\'s some help. Here\\'s some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go to a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. \" And that\\'s what we\\'d say to that person. . President Bush. Whoo! Let me start with the Pell grants. In his last litany of misstatements, he said we cut Pell grants. We\\'ve increased Pell grants by a million students. That\\'s a fact. Here he talks to the workers; let me talk to the workers. You got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed. If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That\\'s money in your pocket. If you\\'re married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage. We created a 10- percent bracket to help lower income Americans. A family of four making 40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief. It\\'s your money. The way my opponent talks, he said we\\'re going to spend the Government\\'s money. No, we\\'re spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you\\'re able to better afford things you want. I believe the role of Government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives. My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric. He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times. . President Bush. Senator, no one is playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they votedâ€”when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. You voted to violate the budget caps 277 times. You know, there\\'s a mainstream in American politics. You sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative Senator from Massachusetts. Same- Sex Marriage . President Bush. You know, Bob, I don\\'t know. I just don\\'t know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America, and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It\\'s important that we do that. I also know, in a free society, people, consenting adults, can live the way they want to live. And that\\'s to be honored. But as we respect someone\\'s rights and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn\\'t changeâ€”or have to change our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it\\'s very important that we protect marriage as an institution between a man and a woman. I proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage. And the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, State legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. I\\'m deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. My opponent was against it. It basically protected States from the action of one State to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But I\\'m concerned that that will get overturned, and if it gets overturned, then we\\'ll end up with marriage being defined by courts. And I don\\'t think that\\'s in our Nation\\'s interest. . President Bush. I think it\\'s important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there\\'s great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. Take, for example, the ban on partial- birth abortion. It\\'s a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the Halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he\\'s out of the mainstream, voted against that law. What I\\'m saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: Continue to promote adoption lawsâ€”that\\'s a great alternative to abortion; continue to fund and promote maternity group homes. I will continue to promote abstinence programs. At the last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That\\'s great, and I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion. Health Care Costs . President Bush. Gosh, I sure hope it\\'s not the administration. [Laughter] No, there is aâ€”look, there\\'s a systemic problem. Health care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decisionmaking process. Most health care costs are covered by third parties, and therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there\\'s no market forces involved with health care. It\\'s one of the reasons I\\'m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low- premium, high- deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax- free savings. Businesses can contribute; employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decisionmaking process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuitsâ€”I don\\'t believe, I knowâ€”that the lawsuits are causing health care costs to rise in America. That\\'s why I\\'m such a strong believer in medical liability reform. At the last debate, my opponent said, \"Well, they onlyâ€”these lawsuits only cause costs to go up by one percent. \" Well, he didn\\'t include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the Federal Government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between 60 and 100 billion dollars a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why there\\'s still high costs in medicine is because this is theâ€”they don\\'t use information technology. It\\'s like if you looked at theâ€”it\\'s the equivalent of the buggy- and- horse days compared to other industries here in America. And so we\\'ve got to introduce high technology into health care. We\\'re beginning to do it. We\\'re changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error as well as to reduce costs. People tell me that when the health care field is fully integrated with information technology, it will wring some 20 percent of the costs out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. So, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care. . President Bush. I think it\\'s important, since he talked about the Medicare planâ€” he\\'s been in the United States Senate for 20 years. He has no record on reforming of health care, no record at all. He introduced some 300 bills, and he\\'s passed 5â€” no record of leadership. I came to Washington to solve problems. I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food, and so I led. And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare. . President Bush. In all due respect, I\\'m not so sure it\\'s credible to quote leading news organizations aboutâ€”well, never mind. Anywayâ€”[laughter]â€”let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the Senator\\'s plan. It costs $1. 2 trillion. The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million peopleâ€”over 20 million people added to Government- controlled health care. It will be the largest increase in Government health care ever. If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the Government is going to insure for them? It\\'s estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to Government insurance. We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think Government- run health will lead to poor quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. Once a health care program ends up in a line item in the Federal Government budget, it leads to more controls. And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor quality health care. Our health care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the Nation\\'s Capital. . President Bush. You talk about the VA. We\\'ve increased VA funding by 22 billion in the 4 years since I\\'ve been President. That\\'s twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding. Of course, we\\'re meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that. We\\'re expanding veterans\\' health care throughout the country. We\\'re aligning facilities where the veterans live now. Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next 4 years. Social Security . President Bush. Bob, first let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we\\'re talking about reforming Social Security, that they\\'ll still get their checks. I remember the 2000 campaign; people said, \"If George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away. \" Well, people got their checks, and they will continue to get their checks. There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem, and if we don\\'t act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. And so I think we need to think differently. We\\'ll honor our commitment to our seniors, but for youngâ€”for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. In recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. This will be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that I\\'m willing to take on. And so I\\'ll bring Republicans and Democrats together, and we\\'re of course going to have to consider the costs. But I want to warn my fellow citizens the cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is okay, far exceeds the cost of trying to make sure we save the system for our children. . President Bush. He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. I didn\\'t hear any plan to fix Social Security. I heard more of the same. He talks about middle- class tax cuts; that\\'s exactly where the tax cuts went. Most of the tax cuts went to low-  and middle- income Americans. And now the Tax Code is more fair; 20 percent of the upper income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. If you have a child, you got tax relief. If you\\'re married, you got tax relief. If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief, all of which was opposed by my opponent. And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession. People need to remember, 6 months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down, and it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession, and we got attacked, which cost us one million jobs. But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months. Sure, there\\'s more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small- business owners. It\\'s not to increase the scope of the Federal Government. It\\'s to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low. Immigration/Border Security . President Bush. I see it as a serious problem. I see it as a security issue; I see it as an economic issue; and I see it as a human rights issue. We\\'re increasing the border security of the United States. We\\'ve got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. We\\'re using new equipment. We\\'re using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across, and we\\'ll continue to do so over the next 4 years. This is a subject I\\'m very familiar with. After all, I was a border Governor for a while. Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. They\\'re coming here to work. If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in Americaâ€”5. 15â€”you\\'re going to come here if you\\'re worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And that\\'s what\\'s happening. And so, in order to take pressure off the border, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary- worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate upâ€”so long as there\\'s not an American willing to do the jobâ€”to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employer\\'s needs. That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren\\'t breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they\\'re not kept in the shadows of our society, that they\\'re able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card will have a period of time attached to it. It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they\\'re not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our Border Patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job. Now, it\\'s very important for our citizens to also know that I don\\'t believe we ought to have amnesty. I don\\'t think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen, and we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line. If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line too. And here\\'s where my opponent and I differ. In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens. . President Bush. Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn\\'t know the borders. They\\'re much better protected today than they were when I was the Governor of Texas. We\\'ve got much more manpower, much more equipment there. He just doesn\\'t understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. That is an outrageous claim. And we\\'ll continue to protect our borders. We\\'ll continue to increase manpower and equipment. . President Bush. Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage. But let me talk about what\\'s really important for the worker you\\'re referring to, and that\\'s to make sure the education system works, is to make sure we raise standards. Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, \"We\\'ll raise standards. We\\'ll increase Federal spending, but in return for extra spending, we now want people to measureâ€”States and local jurisdictions to measure, to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. \" You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem, and we weren\\'t diagnosing problems. And therefore, just kids were being shuffled through the school. And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldn\\'t speak English as first language, just moved through; many inner- city kids, just moved through. We\\'ve stopped that practice now by measuring early, and when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, telling me reading is the new civil right. And she\\'s right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we\\'ve got to get it right in the education system. And we\\'re beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. You see, we\\'d never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn\\'t quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there\\'s excellence in every classroom. Judicial Nominations/Education Funding . President Bush. What he\\'s asking me is will I have a litmus test for my judges, and the answer is no, I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I\\'ll have no litmus test. . President Bush. . President Bush. Two things: One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with. And secondly, only a liberal Senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49- percent increase in funding for education was not enough. We\\'ve increased funds, but more importantly, we\\'ve reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they\\'re too late. He talked about the unemployed. Absolutely, we\\'ve got to make sure they get educated. He talked about children whose parents don\\'t speak English as a first language. Absolutely, we\\'ve got to make sure they get educated. And that\\'s what the No Child Left Behind Act does. . President Bush. The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we\\'re doing. We\\'ll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year. I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the Reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina and Georgia. Some of them had been there before. The people I talked to, the spirits were high. They didn\\'t view their service as a backdoor draft. They view their service as an opportunity to serve their country. My opponent, the Senator, talks about foreign policy. In our first debate, he proposed America pass a \"global test. \" In order to defend ourselves, we have to get international approval. That\\'s one of the major differences we have about defending our country. I work with allies. I work with friends. We\\'ll continue to build strong coalitions. But I will never turn over our national security decisions to leaders of other countries. We\\'ll be resolute. We\\'ll be strong, and we will wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists. . President Bush. In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. The international community, the international world, said this is the right thing to do. But when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force. Apparently, you can\\'t pass any test under his vision of the world. Assault Weapons Ban . President Bush. Actually, I made my intentionsâ€”I made my views clear. I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. Now, I believe law- abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don\\'t get in the hands of people that shouldn\\'t have them. But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And that\\'s why, early in my administration, I called the Attorney General and the U. S. attorneys and said, \"Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crime with guns. \" And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent, I believe is the number. Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns. To me, that\\'s the best way to secure America. . President Bush. Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven\\'t met with the Black Congressional Caucus. I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House. And secondly, like my opponent, I don\\'t agree we ought to have quotasâ€”I agree, we shouldn\\'t have quotas. But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there\\'s Pell grants available for them, which is what we\\'ve done. We\\'ve expanded Pell grants by a million students. Do you realize, today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low-  and middle- income families better afford college? That\\'s the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add, and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small- business loans, which we have increased since I\\'ve been the President of the United States, but to unbundle Government contracts so people will have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. Minority ownership of businesses are up because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong. I thinkâ€”I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something. Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before. And that\\'s hopeful, and that\\'s positive. Candidates\\' Faith . President Bush. First, my faith plays a lotâ€”a big part in my life. And that\\'sâ€” when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot, and I do. And my faith is a veryâ€”it\\'s very personal. I pray for strength. I pray for wisdom. I pray for our troops in harm\\'s way. I pray for my family. I pray for my little girls. But I\\'m mindful, in a free society, that people can worship if they want to or not. You\\'re equally an American if you choose to worship an Almighty and if you choose not to. If you\\'re a Christian, Jew, or Muslim, you\\'re equally an American. That\\'s the great thing about America, is the right to worship the way you see fit. Prayer and religion sustain me. I\\'ve received calmness in the storms of the Presidency. I love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country. Somebody asked me one time, \"Well, how do you know? \" I said, \"I just feel it. \" Religion is an important part. I never want to impose my religion on anybody else, but when I make decisions, I stand on principle. And the principles are derived from who I am. I believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself. That\\'s manifested in public policy through the Faith- Based Initiative, where we\\'ve unleashed the armies of compassion to help sealâ€”heal people who hurt. I believe that God wants everybody to be free. That\\'s what I believe. And that\\'s part of my foreign policy. In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty, and I can\\'t tell you how encouraged I am to see freedom on the march. And so my principles that I make decisions on are a part of me, and religion is a part of me. . President Bush. My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is. I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the Governor of Texas, and I was hopeful to be able to do the same thing. And we made good progress early on. The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy. And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow. But Washington is a tough town, and the way I view it is there\\'s a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are on one side of the issue or another, and they spend enormous sums of money, and they convince different Senators to tout their way or different Congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in. I\\'ll continue in the 4 years to continue to try to work to do so. My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time. It was pretty divided in the 2000 election. So, in other words, it\\'s pretty divided during the 1990s as well. We\\'re just in a period, and we\\'ve got to work to bring it out. My opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I\\'m glad he did. John McCain is for me for President because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq, and my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. Wives and Daughters of the Candidates . President Bush. To listen to themâ€” [laughter]â€”to stand up straight and not scowl. [Laughter] I love the strong women around me. I can\\'t tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters. I amâ€” you know, it\\'s really interesting, I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, \"Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech. \" I said, \"Okay, you got a deal. \" Fortunately, she didn\\'t hold me to that deal, and she\\'s out campaigning, along with our girls, and she speaks English a lot better than I do. [Laughter] I think people understand what she\\'s saying. But they see a compassionate, strong, great First Lady in Laura Bush. I can\\'t tell you how lucky I am when I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O\\'Neill in Midland, Texas. It was the classic backyard barbecue. O\\'Neill said, \"Come on over. I think you\\'ll find somebody who might interest you. \" So I said, \"All right,\" popped over there. There was only four of us there, and not only did she interest me, I guess you could say it was love at first sight. . President Bush. In the Oval Office, there\\'s a painting by a friend of Laura and mine namedâ€”by Tom Lea. It\\'s a west Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene. And he said this about it, he said, \"Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain. It\\'s the sunrise side, not the sunset side. It\\'s the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. \" I love the optimism in that painting because that\\'s how I feel about America. You know, we\\'ve been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years. We\\'ve come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. Over the next 4 years, we\\'ll make sure the economy continues to grow. We reformed our school system, and now there\\'s an achievement gap in America that is beginning to close. Over the next 4 years, we\\'ll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America. Over the next 4 years, we\\'ll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable. Over the next 4 years, we\\'ll continue to rally the armies of compassion to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country\\'s neighborhoods. I\\'m optimistic that we\\'ll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose. We must never waver in the face of this enemy thatâ€”these ideologues of hate. And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we\\'ll also spread freedom and liberty. We\\'ve got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert hostileâ€”a hostile world to a peaceful world. My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America, and a safer world. I want to thank you for listening tonight. I\\'m asking for your vote. God bless you. . President Bush. Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists. Senator, thank you. I canâ€”and thanks, Washington U. as well. I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does. He said he voted for the $87 billion andâ€”or voted against it right before he voted for it. And that sends a confusing signal to people. He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat and now said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power. No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does. You know, for a while, he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He saw the wisdom, until the Democratic primary came along and Howard Dean, the antiwar candidate, began to gain on him. And he changed positions. I don\\'t see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics. He just brought up the tax cut. You remember, we increased that child credit by $1000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10- percent tax bracket for the lower income Americansâ€”that\\'s right at the middle class. He voted against it, and yet he tells you he\\'s for a middle- class tax cut. It\\'sâ€”you\\'ve got to be consistent when you\\'re the President. There\\'s a lot of pressures, and you\\'ve got to be firm and consistent. . President Bush. Each situation is different, Robin. And obviously, we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a President makes is ever to use force. After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days, we\\'d see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. That\\'s why we\\'re bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy- five percent of them have been brought to justice. That\\'s why I said to Afghanistan, \"If you harbor a terrorist, you\\'re just as guilty as the terrorist. \" And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was a serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy. I went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the Oil for Food Programme to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason. He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. That\\'s why he called him a grave threat. I wasn\\'t happy when we found out there wasn\\'t weapons, and we\\'ve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat, and the world is better off without him in power. And my opponent\\'s plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir. . President Bush. Are we going to have a rebuttal thing back and forth? . President Bush. Remember the last debate? My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we use force to protect ourselves. That\\'s the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working. That\\'s the kind of mindset that says let\\'s keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well. Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies. Sanctions were not working. The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein. . President Bush. Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the Finance Minister from Iraq. He came to see me, and he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections. Think about it. They\\'re going from tyranny to elections. He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold. He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free. He said he was optimistic when he came here. Then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric, and all of a sudden he was pessimistic. This is a guy who, along with others, has taken great risk for freedom, and we need to stand with him. My opponent says he has a planâ€”sounds familiar because it\\'s called the Bush plan. We\\'re going to train troops, and we are. We\\'ll have 125,000 trained by the end of December. We\\'re spending about $7 billion. He talks about a grand idea: Let\\'s have a summit; we\\'re going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit. And what is he going to say to those people that show up to the summit? \"Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place\"? Risk your troops in a war you\\'ve called a \"mistake\"? Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn\\'t believe we can succeed and somebody who says the war where we are is a \"mistake. \" I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time. I talk to Tony Blair all the time. I talk to Silvio Berlusconi. They\\'re not going to follow an American President who says, \"Follow me into a mistake. \" Our plan is working. We\\'re going to make elections, and Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it. . President Bush. First of all, we didn\\'t find out he didn\\'t have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons. And secondly, it\\'s a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Usama bin Laden. The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. That\\'s what the war on terror is about. Of course we\\'re going to find Usama bin Laden. We\\'ve already got 75 percent of his people, and we\\'re on the hunt for him. But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve. . President Bush. No, I appreciate that. Iâ€”listen, Iâ€”we\\'ve got a great country. I love our values. And I recognize I\\'ve made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country. I remember when Ronald Reagan was the President. He stood on principle. Some might have called that stubborn. He stood on principle, standing up to the Soviet Union. And we won that conflict, yet at the same time, he was veryâ€”we were very unpopular in Europe because of decisions he made. I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular, but I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security. You know, I\\'ve made some decisions on Israel. That\\'s unpopular. I wouldn\\'t deal with Arafat because I felt like he had let the former President down, and I don\\'t think he\\'s the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state. And people in Europe didn\\'t like that decision. And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do. I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that\\'s committed to democracy and freedom, leadership that will be willing to reject terrorism. I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought toâ€”brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge. I don\\'t think we ought to join that. That was unpopular. And so what I\\'m telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they\\'re right. We\\'ll continue to reach out. Listen, there\\'s 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan. People love America. Sometimes they don\\'t like the decisions made by America, but I don\\'t think you want a President who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing. You don\\'t want to join the International Criminal Court just because it\\'s popular in certain capitals in Europe. . President Bush. I remember sitting in the White House, looking at those generals, saying, \"Do you have what you need in this war? Do you have what it takes? \" I remember going down in the basement of the White House the day we committed our troopsâ€”as last resortâ€”looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, \"Do we have the right plan with the right troop level? \" And they looked me in the eye and said, \"Yes, sir, Mr. President. \" Of course I listened to our generals. That\\'s what a President does. A President sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy. . President Bush. That answer almost made me want to scowl. [Laughter] He keeps talking about letting the inspectors do their job. It\\'s naive and dangerous to say that. That\\'s what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors. Secondly, of course we\\'ve been involved with Iran. I fully understand the threat. And that\\'s why we\\'re doing what he suggested we do, get the Brits, the Germans, and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world, to give up their nuclear ambitions. We\\'ve been doing that. Let me talk about North Korea. It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea. Remember, he is the person who is accusing me of not acting multilaterally. He now wants to take the six- party talks we haveâ€” China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan, and the United Statesâ€”and undermine them by having bilateral talks. That\\'s what President Clinton did. He had bilateral talks with the North Korean, and guess what happened? He didn\\'t honor the agreement. He was enriching uranium. That is a bad policy. Of course, we\\'re paying attention to these. That\\'s a great question about Iran. That\\'s why, in my speech to the Congress, I said there is an axis of evil, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and we\\'re paying attention to it, and we\\'re making progress. . President Bush. Yes, great question. Thanks. I hear there\\'s rumors on the Internets that we\\'re going to have a draft. We\\'re not going to have a draftâ€”period. The All- Volunteer Army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure they\\'ve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets. An all- volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world. We don\\'t need massed armies anymore. One of the things we\\'ve done is we\\'ve taken theâ€”we\\'re beginning to transform our military. And by that I mean we\\'re moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons. We don\\'t need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent. In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with. And so we\\'re moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment. So the answer to your question is, we\\'re withdrawingâ€”not from the worldâ€”we\\'re drawing manpower, so they can be stationed here in America, so there\\'s less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to beâ€”we\\'ll be more likely to keep people in the All- Volunteer Army. One of the most important things we\\'re doing in this administration is transformation. There\\'s some really interesting technologies. For example, we\\'re flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States. That saves manpower, and it saves equipment. It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. Forget all this talk about a draft. We\\'re not going to have a draft so long as I\\'m the President. . President Bush. Let me justâ€”I\\'ve got to answer this. . President Bush. Let me just answer what he just said about going alone. . President Bush. You tell Tony Blair we\\'re going alone. Tell Tony Blair we\\'re going alone. Tell Silvio Berlusconi we\\'re going alone. Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland we\\'re going alone. We\\'ve got 30 countries there. It denigrates an alliance to say we\\'re going alone, to discount their sacrifices. You cannot lead an alliance if you say you\\'re going alone. And people listen. They\\'re sacrificing with us. . President Bush. That\\'s an odd thing to say since we\\'ve tripled the homeland security budget from 10 to 30 billion dollars. Listen, we\\'ll do everything we can to protect the homeland. My opponent is right: We need good intelligence. It\\'s also a curious thing for him to say, since right after 1993, he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7. 5 billion. The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense. We\\'ve got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they\\'ve got to be right once. And that\\'s the reality. And there\\'s a lot of good people working hard. We\\'re doing the best we possibly can to share information. That\\'s why the PATRIOT Act was important. The PATRIOT Act is vital, by the way. It\\'s a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hasn\\'t changed his positions on it. No, but he\\'s for weakening it. I don\\'t think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe. I really don\\'t. First of all, I don\\'t think he can succeed in Iraq. And if Iraq were to fail, it would be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money, and the world would be much more dangerous. I don\\'t see how you can win in Iraq if you don\\'t believe we should be there in the first place. I don\\'t see how you can lead troops if you say, \"It\\'s the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. \" I don\\'t see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American President if all they hear is that it was a \"mistake\" to be there in the first place. This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination. And it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida, but we disrupt terrorists\\' safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support. . President Bush. Well, we\\'ll talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute. But yes, I\\'m worried. I\\'m worried. I\\'m worried about our country. And all I can tell you is, every day I know that there\\'s people working overtime, doing the very best they can. And the reason I\\'m worried is because there\\'s a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate. And the way to defeat them long- term, by the way, is to spread freedom. Liberty can change habits, and that\\'s what\\'s happening in Afghanistan and Iraq. . President Bush. I haven\\'t yet. I just want to make sure they\\'re safe. When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn\\'t kill you. And that\\'s why the FDA and that\\'s why the Surgeon General are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way. I\\'ve got an obligation to make sure our Government does everything we can to protect you. And one ofâ€”my worry is that it looks like it\\'s from Canada, and it might be from a third world. We\\'ve just got to make sure, before somebody thinks they\\'re buying a product, that it works. And that\\'s why we\\'re doing what we\\'re doing. Now, it may very well be, here in December, you hear me say, \"I think there\\'s a safe way to do it. \" Other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper: One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And we\\'re doing just that. Another is to get our seniors to sign up for these drug discount cards, and they\\'re working. Wanda Blackmore, I met here from Missouriâ€”the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card she paid $1. 14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. These cards make sense. And you know, in 2006, seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare, because I went to Washington to fix problems. Medicareâ€”the issue of Medicare used to be called \"Medi- scare. \" People didn\\'t want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically. I wanted to get something done. I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system. And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage. Thank you for asking. . President Bush. If they\\'re safe, they\\'re coming. I want to remind you that it wasn\\'t just my administration that made the decision on safety. President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you. Now, he talks about Medicare. He\\'s been in the United States Senate 20 years. Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished. I\\'ve been in Washington, DC, 3 1/2 years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system. That\\'s what leadership is all about. . President Bush. Let me see where to start here. First, the National Journal named Senator Kerry * the most liberal Senator of all. And that\\'s saying something in that bunch. You might say that took a lot of hard work. The reason I bring that up is because he\\'s proposed $2. 2 trillion in new spending and he says he\\'s going to tax the rich to close the tax gap. He can\\'t. He\\'s going to tax everybody here to fund his programs. That\\'s just reality. And what are his health programs? First, he says he\\'s for medical liability reform, particularly for ob- gyns. There was a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he\\'s so much for it. Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause one percent increase. That shows a lack of understanding. Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our Government $28 billion a year. And finally, he says he\\'s going to have a novel health care plan. You know what it is? The Federal Government is going to run it. It is the largest increase in Federal Government health care ever, and it fits with his philosophy. That\\'s why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal. That\\'s what liberals do: They create Government- sponsored health care. Maybe you think that makes sense. I don\\'t. Government- sponsored health care would lead to rationing. It would ruin the quality of health care in America. . President Bush. What does matter is the plan. He said he is forâ€”you\\'re now for capping punitive damages? That\\'s odd. You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then. Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem. He\\'s been in the United States Senate for 20 years, and he hasn\\'t addressed it. We passed it out of the House of Representatives. Guess where it stuck? It stuck in the Senate because the trial lawyers won\\'t act on it, and he put a trial lawyer on the ticket. . President Bush. Right. Thank you for that. We have a deficit. We have a deficit because this country went into a recession. You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically 6 months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped. And that cost us rev- enueâ€”that cost us revenue. Secondly, we\\'re at war. And I\\'m going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just 120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. We\\'ve got to pay our troops more. We have. We\\'ve increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I just told this lady over here we spentâ€”went from 10 to 30 billion dollars to protect the homeland. I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money. Plus, we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that they\\'d get out of the recession. I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during tough economic times, it increases demand or investment. Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added. We found out today that over the past 13 months, we\\'ve added 1. 9 million new jobs in the last 13 months. I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by 5 years. And you\\'re right, I haven\\'t vetoed any spending bills because we worked together. Non- homeland, non- defense, discretionary spending was rising at 15 percent a year when I got into office. And today, it\\'s less than one percent, because we\\'re working together to try to bring this deficit under control. Like you, I\\'m concerned about the deficit. But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm\\'s way. And I\\'m not going to run up taxes which will cost this economy jobs. Thank you for your question. . President Bush. Look at the budget. One is, make sure Congress doesn\\'t overspend. But let me talk back about where we\\'ve been. The stock market was declining 6 months prior to my arrival. It was the largest stock market correctionâ€”one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession. Because we cut taxes on everybodyâ€” remember, we ran up the child credit by 1,000; we reduced the marriage penalty; we created the 10- percent bracket; everybody who pays taxes got reliefâ€”the recession was one of the shortest in our Nation\\'s history. . President Bush. It\\'s just not credible. When he talks about being fiscally conservative, it\\'s just not credible. If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the spendingâ€”the caps, the spending caps, over 200 times, and here he says he\\'s going to be a fiscal conservative all of a sudden. It\\'s just not credible. You cannot believe it. And of course he\\'s going to raise your taxes. You see, he\\'s proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending. And so they said, \"Well, how are you going to pay for it? \" He said, well, he\\'s going to raise the taxes on the rich. That\\'s what he said, the top two brackets. That raisesâ€”he says 800 billion; we say 600 billion. We\\'ve got battling green eyeshadesâ€”somewhere in between those numbers. And so there is a difference, what he\\'s promised and what he could raise. Now, either he\\'s going to break all these wonderful promises he\\'s told you about, or he\\'s going to raise taxes. And I suspect, given his record, he\\'s going to raise taxes. Is my time up yet? . President Bush. Keep going, good. [Laughter] . President Bush. You looked at me like my clock was up. I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is to have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform. As I told you, we just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we\\'ve created 1. 9 million new jobs. We\\'re growing. And so the fundamental question of this campaign is, who\\'s going to keep the economy growing so people can work? That\\'s the fundamental question. . President Bush. Yes, I mean, he\\'s got a record. He\\'s been there for 20 years. You can run, but you can\\'t hide. He voted 98 times to raise taxes. I mean, these aren\\'t make- up figures. And so people are going to have to look at the recordâ€”look at the record of the man running for the President. They don\\'t name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn\\'t shown up to many meetings. They named him because of his votes, and it\\'s reality. It\\'s just not credible to say he\\'s going to keep taxes down and balance budgets. . President Bush. Off- road diesel enginesâ€”we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off- road diesel engines by 90 percent. I\\'ve got a plan to increase the wetlands by 3 million. We\\'ve got an aggressive brownfield program to refurbish inner- city sore spots to useful pieces of property. I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury by 70 percent. I wasâ€”fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the Conservation Reserve Program to set aside millions of acres of land forâ€”to help improve wildlife in the habitat. We proposed and passed a Healthy Forests bill, which was essential to working withâ€”particularly in western States, to make sure that our forests were protected. What happens in those forests, because of lousy Federal policy, is they grow to beâ€” they are notâ€”they\\'re not harvested. They\\'re not taken care of, and as a result, they\\'re like tinder boxes. And over the last summers I\\'ve flown over there. And so this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and, at the same time, make sure our forests aren\\'t vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West. We\\'ve got a good, commonsense policy. Now, I\\'m going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time, is technology is going to change the way we live, for the good, for the environment. So I proposed a hydrogen automobile, a hydrogen- generated automobile. We\\'re spending a billion dollars to come up with the technologies to do that. That\\'s why I\\'m a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way. I guess you\\'d say I\\'m a good steward of the land. The quality of the air is cleaner since I\\'ve been the President; fewer water complaints since I\\'ve been the President; more land being restored since I\\'ve been the President. Thank you for your question. . President Bush. Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he\\'s referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs. It\\'s one of these deals where in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty. But I thought it would cost a lot ofâ€”I think there\\'s a better way to do it. And I just told you the facts, sir. The quality of the air is cleaner since I\\'ve been the President of the United States. And we\\'ll continue to spend money on research and development because I truly believe that\\'s the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we\\'re accustomed to and being able to protect our environment bet- terâ€”the use of technologies. . President Bush. I have a plan to cover those folks, and it\\'s a plan that lowers costs for everybody, covers all children. And the way I pay for itâ€”I\\'m not fiscally irresponsibleâ€”is I roll back the tax cut that this President so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie. I think you ought to get the break. I want to lower your cost of health care. I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special needs education. And that\\'s how we\\'re going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college. China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are. We\\'ve got to create the products of the future. That\\'s why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years. And we\\'re going to put our laboratories and our colleges and universities to work, and we\\'re going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and we\\'re going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil. That\\'s how you create jobs and become competitive. . President Bush. Let me start with how to control the costs of health care: Medical liability reform, for starters, which he\\'s opposed. Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do. Thirdly, spread what\\'s called health savings accounts. It\\'s good for small businesses, good for owners. You own your own account. You can save tax- free. You get a catastrophic plan to help youâ€” own it. This is different from saying, \"Okay, let me incent you to go on the Government. \" He\\'s talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know, he calls it an outsourcingâ€”to keepâ€”stop outsourcing. Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it won\\'t work. The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan. I proposed one to the Congress 2 years ago. It encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal and use coal and gas. It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel. It\\'s stuck in the Senate. He and his runningmate didn\\'t show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate. Less regulations if we want jobs here. Legal reform if we want jobs here. And we\\'ve got to keep taxes low. Now, he says he\\'s only going to tax the rich. Do you realize 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income- tax level. And so when you\\'re running up the taxes like that, you\\'re taxing job creators, and that\\'s not how you keep jobs here. . President Bush. I own a timber company? That\\'s news to me. [Laughter] Need some wood? [Laughter] Most small businesses are Subchapter S corps. They just are. I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio. He\\'s creating jobs. Most small businessesâ€”70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small business. His taxes are going up when you run up the top two brackets. It\\'s a fact. . President Bush. Yes, I appreciate that. I really don\\'t think your rights are being watered down. As a matter of fact, I wouldn\\'t support it if I thought that. Every action being taken against terrorists requires a court order, requires scrutiny. As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we\\'ve been using against drug dealers and white- collar criminals. So I really don\\'t think so. I hope you don\\'t think that. I mean, Iâ€”because I think whoever is the President must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America. The PATRIOT Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn\\'t talk to each other. Intelligence gathering and the law enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn\\'t share intelligence under the old law, and that didn\\'t make any sense. Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again. That\\'s the task of the 21st century. And so I don\\'t think the PATRIOT Act abridges your rights at all, and I know it\\'s necessary. I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust the Lackawanna cell up there. And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the PATRIOT Act. . President Bush. Embryonic stem cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell. I\\'m the first President ever to allow funding, Federal funding, for embryonic stem cell research. I did so because I too hope that we\\'ll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived. But I think we\\'ve got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science. And so I made the decision we wouldn\\'t spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action, because science is important but so is ethics, so is balancing life. To destroy life to save life is one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face. There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist, that are active, and hopefully we find a cure. But as well we need to continue to pursue adult stem cell research. I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures. And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life. . President Bush. Let me make sure you understand my decision. Those stem cell lines already existed. The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision. I had to make the decision: Do we destroy more life; do we continue to destroy life? I made the decision to balance science and ethics. . President Bush. I\\'m not telling. [Laughter] I really don\\'t haveâ€”I haven\\'t picked anybody yet. Plus, I want them all voting for me. [Laughter] I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law. I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States. Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn\\'t pick. I wouldn\\'t pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn\\'t be said in a school because it had the words \"under God\" in it. I think that\\'s an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decisionmaking process, as opposed to strict interpretation of the Constitution. Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges years ago said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights. That\\'s personal opinion. That\\'s not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says we\\'re allâ€”it doesn\\'t say that. It doesn\\'t speak to the equality of America. And so I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. We\\'ve got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, DC. Legislators make law. Judges interpret the Constitution. And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next yearâ€”next 4 years. And that\\'s the kind of judge I\\'m going to put on thereâ€”no litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution. . President Bush. Trying to decipher that. [Laughter] My answer is we\\'re not going to spend Federal taxpayers\\' money on abortion. This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America. I signed the ban on partial- birth abortion. It\\'s a brutal practice. It\\'s one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban. I think there ought to be parental notification laws. He\\'s against them. I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. In other words, if you\\'re a mom and you\\'re pregnant, you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that. These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life. I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion. And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done. Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it\\'s going to be a hospitable society. Thank you. . President Bush. It\\'s pretty simple when they say, \"Are you for a ban on partial- birth abortion? Yes or no. \" And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no. And that\\'s just the way it is. That\\'s a vote. It came right up. It\\'s clear for everybody to see. And as I said, you can run, but you can\\'t hide. It\\'s the reality. . President Bush. Put a head fake on. . President Bush. I have made a lot of decisions, some of them little, like appointments to a board you\\'ve never heard of, and some of them big. And in a war, there\\'s a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say, \"You shouldn\\'t have done that. You shouldn\\'t have made that decision. \" And I\\'ll take responsibility for them. I\\'m human. But on the big questions about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I\\'ll stand by those decisions because I think they\\'re right. That\\'s really what you\\'reâ€” when they ask about the mistakes, that\\'s what they\\'re talking about. They\\'re trying to say, \"Did you make a mistake going into Iraq? \" And the answer is absolutely not. It was the right decision. The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program, and the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. We knew he hated us. We knew he had been aâ€”invaded other countries. We knew he tortured his own people. On the tax cut, it\\'s a big decision. I did the right decision. Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history. Now, you ask what mistakesâ€”I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I\\'m not going to name them. I don\\'t want to hurt their feelings on national TV. But history will look back, and I\\'m fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration. Because the President makes the decisions, the President has to take the responsibility. . President Bush. He complains about the fact our troops don\\'t have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: \"I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it. \" Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma\\'am. And he was a risk thatâ€”and this is where we just have a difference of opinion. The truth of the matter is, if you listen carefully: Saddam would still be in power if he were the President of the United States, and the world would be \"a lot better off. \" . President Bush. Go ahead. Actuallyâ€”â€” . President Bush. Either way. [Laughter] . President Bush. . President Bush. Charlie, thanks. Thank you all very much. It\\'s been enjoyable. The great contest for the Presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done. We\\'ve been through a lot together as a country, been through a recession, corporate scandals, war. And yet, think about where we are. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the past 13 months. The farm income in America is high. Small businesses are flourishing. Homeownership rate is at an alltime high in America. We\\'re on the move. Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: Keep the taxes low, don\\'t increase the scope of the Federal Government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health care policy that does not empower the Federal Government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And abroad, we\\'re at war, and it requires a President who is steadfast and strong and determined. I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we\\'re safe. The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer, but not yet safe. There\\'s more work to be done. We\\'ll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida. We\\'ll deny sanctuary to these terrorists. We\\'ll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. The great nexus, the great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction. But our long- term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. We\\'ll continue to promote freedom around the world. Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow Afghanistan will be voting for a President. In Iraq, we\\'ll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful. God bless. . President Bush. I too thank the University of Miami and say our prayers are with the good people of this State who\\'ve suffered a lot. September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our Nation has been on a multipronged strategy to keep our country safer. We\\'ve pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide; 75 percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know we\\'re after them. We\\'ve upheld the doctrine that said, \"If you harbor a terrorist, you\\'re equally as guilty as the terrorist. \" And the Taliban, no longer in power; 10 million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming Presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Libya has disarmed. The A. Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And as well, we\\'re pursuing a strategy ofâ€”of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror; free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people; free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want. Likelihood of Future Terrorist Attack . President Bush. No, I don\\'t believe it\\'s going to happen. I believe I\\'m going to win because the American people know I know how to lead. I\\'ve shown the American people I know how to lead. I haveâ€”I understand everybody in this country doesn\\'t agree with the decisions that I\\'ve made, and I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe, and that\\'s how best it is to keep the peace. This Nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate, and that\\'s what they are. This is a group of killers who will not only kill here but kill children in Russia, that will attack unmercifully in Iraq hoping to shake our will. We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren. The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive, and at the same time, spread liberty. And that\\'s what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan. Ten million citizens have registered to vote. It\\'s a phenomenal statistic, that if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. Forty- one percent of those 10 million are women. In Iraq, no doubt about it, it\\'s tough. It\\'s hard work. It\\'s incredibly hard. You know why? Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. That\\'s why they\\'re fighting so vociferously. They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there because they tried to beat us, and they didn\\'t. And they\\'re showing up in Iraq for the same reason. They\\'re trying to defeat us. And if we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy. . President Bush. My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared, in 2002, that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. He also said, in December of 2003, that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be President. I agree with him. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein. I was hoping diplomacy would work. I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm\\'s way. It\\'s the hardest decision a President makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didn\\'t need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations; I decided to go there myself. And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands. And they passed a resolution that said, \"Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. \" I believe when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. But Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions, and nothing took place. As a matter of factâ€”my opponent talks about inspectorsâ€”the facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasn\\'t going to work. That\\'s kind of a pre- September- 10th mentality, to hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping we\\'d turn away. But there was, fortunately, others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action, and we did. The world is safer without Saddam Hussein. Priorities in the War on Terror . President Bush. Jim, we\\'ve got the capability of doing both. As a matter of fact, this is a global effort. We\\'re facing aâ€” a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they\\'ll strike anywhere with any means. And that\\'s why it\\'s essential that we have strong alliances, and we do. That\\'s why it\\'s essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are. But to say that there\\'s only one focus on the war on terror doesn\\'t really understand the nature of the war on terror. Of course we\\'re after Saddam Husseinâ€” I mean, bin Laden. He\\'sâ€”he\\'s isolated. Seventy- five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer inâ€”the mastermind of the September the 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammad, is in prison. We\\'re making progress, but the front on this war is more than just one place. The Philippinesâ€”we\\'ve got helpâ€”we\\'re helping them there to bringâ€”to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there. And of course Iraq is a central part of the war on terror. That\\'s why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. We\\'ve got a plan to do so, and the main reason we\\'ll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. He\\'s a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. He doesn\\'t want U. S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. We\\'re spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. That\\'s the plan for victory. And when Iraq is free, America will be more secure. . President Bush. Can I respond? . President Bush. Thank you, sir. First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says, \"It\\'s the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. \" I don\\'t see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say \"wrong war, wrong time, wrong place. \" What message does that send our troops? What message does that send our allies? What message does that send the Iraqis? No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I\\'ve just outlined. . President Bush. I don\\'t think we want to get to how he\\'s going to pay for all these promises. It\\'s like a huge tax gap andâ€”anyway, that\\'s for another debate. My administration has tripled the amount of money we\\'re spending on homeland security, to $30 billion a year. My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. We\\'ve got 1,000 extra Border Patrol on the southern border, more than 1,000 on the northern border. We\\'re modernizing our borders. We\\'ve spent $3. 1 billion for fire and policeâ€”$3. 1 billion. We\\'re doing our duty to provide the funding. But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense. We have to be right 100 percent of the time, and the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us. There\\'s a lot of good people working hard. And by the way, we\\'ve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. We\\'re communicating better. We\\'re going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible. The PATRIOT Act is vital. It\\'s vital that the Congress renew the PATRIOT Act, which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terrorist cells. But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protect you is to stay on the offense. . President Bush. Of course we\\'re doing everything we can to protect America. I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. That\\'s my job. I work with Director Mueller of the FBI. He comes into my office, when I\\'m in Washington, every morning talking about how to protect us. There\\'s a lot of really good people working hard to do so. It\\'s hard work. But again, I want to tell the American people, we\\'re doing everything we can at home, but you better have a President who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again. Criteria for Withdrawal of U. S. Troops From Iraq . President Bush. Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. And that\\'s what we\\'re doing. We got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, over 200,000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. We\\'ll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands and protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops homeâ€”which I really want to do, but I don\\'t want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we\\'ve achieved an objectiveâ€”is to see the Iraqis perform, is to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so the answer to your question is, when our generals on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that there\\'s stability, and that they\\'re on their way toâ€”you know, a nation ofâ€” that\\'s free. That\\'s when. And I hope it\\'s as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines won\\'t work. My opponent one time said, \"Well, get me elected, I\\'ll have them out of there in 6 months. \" That\\'sâ€”you can\\'t do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is: Thank you for what you\\'re doing; we\\'re standing with you strong; we\\'ll give you all the equipment you need; and we\\'ll get you home as soon as the mission\\'s done, because this is a vital mission. A free Iraq will be a ally in the war on terror, and that\\'s essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country. . President Bush. Jimâ€”â€” . President Bush. I think it\\'s worthy for a followupâ€”â€” . President Bush. â€”â€”if you don\\'t mind. . President Bush. All right. My opponent says, \"Help is on the way,\" but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm\\'s way, \"wrong war, wrong place, wrong time\"? That\\'s not a message a Commander in Chief givesâ€”or \"This is a great diversion. \" As well, help is on the way, but it\\'s certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87 billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it. That\\'s not what Commander in Chiefs does when you\\'re trying to lead troops. . President Bush. That\\'s totally absurd. Of course the U. N. was invited in, and we support the U. N. efforts there. They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed, but they\\'re now back in, helping with elections. My opponent says we didn\\'t have any allies in this war? What\\'s he say to Tony Blair? What\\'s he say to Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland? I mean, you can\\'t expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq. Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve. So what\\'s the message going to be? \"Please join us in Iraq for a grand diversion\"? \"Join us for a war that is a wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time\"? I know how these people think. I deal with them all the time. I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently. They\\'re not going to follow somebody who says this is \"the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. \" They\\'re not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America. And finally, he says we ought to have a summit. Well, there are summits being held. Japan is going to have a summit for the donors. There\\'s $14 billion pledged, and Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account to get them to contribute. And there\\'s going to be an Arab summit of the neighborhood countries, and Colin Powell helped set up that summit. . President Bush. Well, actually, he forgot Poland. And now, there are 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops, and I honor their sacrifices. And I don\\'t appreciate it when a candidate for President denigrates the contributions of these braveâ€”brave soldiers. It\\'sâ€”you cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us. He called them the \"coerced and the bribed. \" That\\'s not how you bring people together. Our coalition is strong. It will remain strong, for myâ€”so long as I\\'m the President. Postwar Iraq . President Bush. No, what I said was that because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around. In other words, we thought we\\'d whip more of them going in. But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Ba\\'athists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. I thought we wouldâ€”they would stay and fight, but they didn\\'t. And now we\\'re fighting them now. It\\'sâ€”and it\\'s hard work. I understand how hard it is. I get the casualty reports every day. I see on the TV screens how hard it is, but it\\'s necessary work. And I\\'m optimistic. See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. I\\'m optimistic we\\'ll achieveâ€”I know we won\\'t achieve if we send mixed signals. I know we\\'re not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens. We\\'ve got a plan in place. The plan says there\\'ll be elections in January, and there will be. The plan says we\\'ll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are. And it\\'s not only just America, but NATO is now helping. Jordan is helping train police. The UAE is helping train police. We\\'ve allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts, and we\\'re making progress there. And our alliance is strong. Now, I just told you, there\\'s going to be a summit of the Arab nations. Japan will be hosting a summit. We\\'re making progress. It is hard work. It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy. It\\'s hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off or executed, to a place where people are free. But it\\'s necessary work, and a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place. . President Bush. My opponent just said something amazing. He said Usama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America. Usama bin Laden isn\\'t going to determine how we defend ourselves. Usama bin Laden doesn\\'t get to decide. The American people decide. I decided. The right action was in Iraq. My opponent calls it a mistake. It wasn\\'t a mistake. He said I misled on Iraq. I don\\'t think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002. I don\\'t think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003. I don\\'t think he misled you when he said that ifâ€”anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn\\'t have the judgment to be President. I don\\'t think he was misleading. I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war, and he has. As the politics change, his positions change, and that\\'s not how a Commander in Chief acts. Iâ€”let me finish. The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence. And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force. . President Bush. The only thing consistent about my opponent\\'s position is that he\\'s been inconsistent. He changes positions. And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win. And I expect to win. It\\'s necessary we win. We\\'re being challenged like never before, and we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction. Hard Decisions/Support for the Military . President Bush. No, every life is precious. Every life matters. You know, my hardestâ€”the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm\\'s way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband and wife. And you know, I think about Missy Johnson, who is a fantastic young lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina, she and her son, Bryan. They came to see me. Her husband, P. J. , got killed. He\\'d been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq. You know, it\\'s hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm\\'s way. I told her, after we prayed and teared up and laughed some, that I thought her husband\\'s sacrifice was noble and worthy, because I understand the stakes of this war on terror. I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide. We must deal with threats before they fully materializeâ€” and Saddam Hussein was a threatâ€”and that we must spread liberty, because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom. Missy understood that. That\\'s what she told me her husband understood. So you say, was it worth it? Every life is precious. That\\'s what distinguishes us from the enemy. Everybody matters. But I think it\\'s worth it, Jim. I think it\\'s worth it because I thinkâ€”I know in the long term, a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan will set such a powerful example in the part of the world that\\'s desperate for freedomâ€” it will help change the worldâ€”that we can look back and say, \"We did our duty. \" . President Bush. I understand what it means to be the Commander in Chief, and if I were to ever say this is the wrong war at the wrong time at the rightâ€”wrong place, the troops would wonder, \"How can I follow this guy? \" You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, \"Well, this is just a grand diversion. \" It\\'s not a grand diversion. This is an essential, that we get it right. And so Iâ€”the plan he talks about simply won\\'t work. . President Bush. There\\'s 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol. There\\'s going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year. Yes, we\\'re getting the job done. It\\'s hard work. Everybody knows it\\'s hard work because there\\'s a determined enemy that\\'s trying to defeat us. Now, my opponent says he\\'s going to try to change the dynamics on the ground. Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here. He is the leader of that country. He\\'s a brave, brave man. When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility. You can\\'t change the dynamics on the ground if you\\'ve criticized the brave leader of Iraq. One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet. That\\'s no way to treat somebody who\\'s courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward. The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word; that we stand with you; that we believe you want to be free. And I do. I believe that the 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections. I reject this notionâ€”and I\\'m not suggesting that my opponent says it, but I reject the notion that some say that if you\\'re Muslim you can\\'t be free; you don\\'t desire freedom. I disagree, strongly disagree with that. . President Bush. Yes, let meâ€”â€” . President Bush. The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they\\'re coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror. They\\'re fighting us because they\\'re fighting freedom. They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them, and those are the stakes. And that\\'s why it is essential we not leave. That\\'s why it\\'s essential we hold the line. That\\'s why it\\'s essential we win, and we will. Under my leadership, we\\'re going to win this war in Iraq. Future U. S. Military Action . President Bush. I would hope I never have to. I understand how hard it is to commit troops. I never wanted to commit troops. I neverâ€”when I was runningâ€” when we had the debate in 2000, I never dreamt I would be doing that. But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us. I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we\\'ll ever have to use troops. But a President must always be willing to use troops. It mustâ€”as a last resort. Theâ€”I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye. And if he had been in powerâ€”in other words, we had said, \"Let\\'s let the inspectors work,\" or \"Let\\'s hope to talk him out; maybe an 18th resolution would work,\" he\\'d have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. There\\'s just no doubt in my mind. We would rue the day if Saddam Hussein had been in power. So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. And Iâ€”I would hope never to have to use force. But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we\\'ve affected the world in a positive way. Look at Libya. Libya was a threat. Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs. Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine, and the world is better for it. So to answer your question, I would hope we\\'d never have to. I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it\\'s less likely toâ€”less likely we have to use force. . President Bush. First, listenâ€”â€” . President Bush. â€”â€”of course I know Usama bin Laden attacked us. I know that. And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose is ludicrous, in my judgment. It just shows a significant difference of opinion. We tried diplomacy. We did our best. He was hoping to turn a blind eye, and, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him. He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons. . President Bush. Let meâ€”I\\'m not exactly sure what you mean, \"passes the global test. \" You take preemptive action if you pass a global test? My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure. My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties. But let me tell you one thing I didn\\'t signâ€”and I think it shows a difference of our opinion, the difference of opinionsâ€”and that is that I wouldn\\'t join the International Criminal Court. This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors could pull our troops, our diplomats up for trial. And I wouldn\\'t join it. And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn\\'t a popular move. But it\\'s the right move, not to join a foreign court that couldâ€”where our people could be prosecuted. My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court. I just think trying to be popular kind of in the global sense, if it\\'s not in our best interest, makes no sense. I\\'m interested in working with other nations and do a lot of it. But I\\'m not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America. North Korea and Iran . President Bush. North Korea, firstâ€”I do. Let me say I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this Government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, justâ€”besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear- weapons- free Northâ€”peninsulaâ€”Korean Peninsula was in his interest and our interest and the world\\'s interest. And so we began a new dialog with North Korea, one that included not only the United States but now China. And China has got a lot of influence over North Korea, in some ways more than we do. As well we included South Korea, Japan, and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Chong- il, not just one. And so if Kim Chong- il decides again to not honor an agreement, he\\'s not only doing injustice to America, he\\'d be doing injustice to China as well. And I think this will work. It\\'s not going to work if we open up a dialog with Kim Chong- il. That\\'s what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talksâ€”or the fiveâ€”the five- nation coalition that\\'s sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We\\'ve worked very closely with the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. There\\'s a special protocol recently been passed that allows for instant inspections. I hope we can do it, and we\\'ve got a good strategy. . President Bush. Right. . President Bush. The minute we have bilateral talks, the six- party talks will unwind. It\\'s exactly what Kim Chong- il wants. And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not to plutonium. The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium. That\\'s what we caught him doing. That\\'s where he was breaking the agreement. Secondly, you saidâ€”my opponent said that he\\'d work to put sanctions on Iran. We\\'ve already sanctioned Iran. We can\\'t sanction them anymore. There are sanctions in place on Iran. And finally, we were a party to the convincingâ€”to working with Germany, France, and Great Britain to send their Foreign Ministers into Iran. Iran/Sudan . President Bush. Back to Iran, just for a second. It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran. That happened long before I arrived in Washington, DC. In terms of Darfur, I agree, it\\'s genocide, and Colin Powell so stated. We have committed $200 million worth of aid. We\\'re the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there. We will commit more, over time, to help. We were very much involved at the U. N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir Government in the Sudan. Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north- south agreement that we would hope would have brought peace to the Sudan. I agree with my opponent that we shouldn\\'t be committing troops, that we ought to be working with the African Union to do soâ€”precisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out. My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives. Fortunately, the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long- suffering people there. Character of the Candidates . President Bush. There are clearly, as we have heard, major policy differences between the two of you. Are there also underlying character issues that you believeâ€”that you believeâ€” are serious enough to deny Senator Kerry the job as Commander in Chief of the United States? . President Bush. Whew, that\\'s a loaded question. [Laughter] First of all, I admire Senator Kerry\\'s service to our country. I admire the fact that he is a great dad. I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls seeing their dads out there campaigning. I admire the fact that he\\'s served for 20 years in the Senate, although I\\'m not so sure I admire the record. I won\\'t hold it against him that he went to Yale. Nothing wrong with that. Iâ€”my concerns about the Senator is that in the course of this campaign I\\'ve been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changed his positions on the war in Iraq, changed his positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens. And that\\'s my biggest concern about my opponent. I admire his service. But I just know how this world works and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U. S. President. Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world. . President Bush. I\\'m trying to put a leash on them. [Laughter] . President Bush. Thank you. . President Bush. Well, I thinkâ€”listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will in Iraq. Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed. But what I won\\'t do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure. And it isâ€”one of the things I\\'ve learned in the White House is that there\\'s enormous pressure on the President, and you cannot wilt under that pressure. Otherwise the world won\\'t be better off. . President Bush. Actually, we\\'ve increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I\\'ve been the President. Secondly, we\\'ve set up what\\'s called theâ€”well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network. And that\\'s why we\\'ve put proliferation as theâ€”one of the centerpieces of a multipronged strategy to make the country safer. My administration started what is called the Proliferation Security Initiative, over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans- shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And we\\'reâ€” been effective. We busted the A. Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. It was an essential part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. I\\'ll tell you another way to help protect America in the longâ€”in the long run is continue with missile defenses, and we\\'ve got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration. We\\'ll be implementing a missile defense system relatively quickly. And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century. My opponent is opposed to the missile defenses. . President Bush. In the hands of a terrorist enemy. . President Bush. Again, I can\\'t tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea. It\\'s precisely what Kim Chong- il wants. It will cause the six- party talks to evaporate. It means that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Chong- il to get rid of his weapons. It\\'s a big mistake to do that. We must have China\\'s leverage on Kim Chong- il, besides ourselves. And if you enter bilateral talks, they\\'ll be happy to walk away from the table. I don\\'t think that will work. President Vladimir Putin of Russia . President Bush. No, I don\\'t think it\\'s okay and said so publicly. I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy and made that very clearâ€”that by consolidating power in a central government, he\\'s sending a signal to the Western world and the United States thatâ€”that perhaps he doesn\\'t believe in checks and balances. And I\\'ve told him that. He\\'s also a strong ally in the war on terror. He isâ€”listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan where these terrorists gunned down young school kids. But it\\'s the nature of the enemy, by the way. That\\'s why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice. It\\'s precisely what Vladimir Putin understands as well. I\\'ve got a good relation with Vladimir, and it\\'s important that we do have a good relation because that enables me to better comment to him and toâ€”better to discuss with him some of the decisions he makes. I found that in this world that it\\'s important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you\\'re able to disagree in a way that is effective. And so I\\'ve told him my opinion. I look forward to discussing it more with him as time goes on. Russia is a country in transition. Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices, and I think it\\'s very important for the American President as well as other Western leaders to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams. And I will continue working with him over the next 4 years. . President Bush. You know my opinion on North Korea. I can\\'t say it any more plainly. . President Bush. Pardon me? . President Bush. Oh, I\\'m a pretty calm guy. [Laughter] I mean, I don\\'t take it personally. . President Bush. But you know, look, we looked at the same intelligence. We came to the same conclusion, that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. And I don\\'t hold it against him that he said \"grave threat. \" I\\'m not going to go around the country saying he didn\\'t tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did. . President Bush. Thank you very much, tonight, Jim. Thank you, Senator. If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. That\\'s not going to happen so long as I\\'m your President. In the next 4 years, we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses. We will strengthen our intelligence gathering services. We will reform our military. The military will be an all- volunteer army. We will continue to stay on the offense. We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home. We\\'ll continue to build our alliances. I\\'ll never turn over America\\'s national security needs to leaders of other countries as we continue to build those alliances. And we\\'ll continue to spread freedom. I believe in the transformational power of liberty. I believe that a free Iraq is in this Nation\\'s interests. I believe a free Afghanistan is in this Nation\\'s interests, and I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East. We\\'ve done a lot of hard work together over the last 3 1/2 years. We\\'ve been challenged, and we\\'ve risen to those challenges. We\\'ve climbed the mighty mountain. I see the valley below, and it\\'s a valley of peace. By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want. I appreciate your listening tonight. I ask for your vote. And may God continue to bless our great land. . President Bush. From Coral Gables, Florida, I\\'m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.

Good evening. Love that southern hospitality. Good evening to all of you in the Peace Center for Performing Arts here in Greenville, South Carolina, and to our national television audience as well. This is a very important occasion, obviously. This is the first of the southern primaries in this long election year, one of seven states that will hold primaries or caucuses next Tuesday. And we want to give a special thanks to the Young Democrats of South Carolina and Furman University, who are the sponsors here tonight. (APPLAUSE) Our seven candidates on stage are in positions that were by draw. They will have one minute to respond to my questions, 30 seconds for rebuttal, but we\\'re not going to have any lights or buzzers. We will be keeping track backstage to make sure that everyone gets an equal distribution of time. So let me now introduce to you the real stars of the evening, these candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Former General Wesley Clark. (APPLAUSE) Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman. (APPLAUSE) Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. . : Former Vermont governor, Howard Dean. (APPLAUSE) Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. (APPLAUSE) The Reverend Al Sharpton of New York. (APPLAUSE) And Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. (APPLAUSE) Gentlemen, I don\\'t want to dwell on this, but there\\'s no question about the fact that the configuration of this race has changed as a result of what happened both in Iowa and New Hampshire - -  big victories for Senator John Kerry. The voters there told us that electability was a big issue, so we\\'re going to take just a few moments at the beginning to talk about how the race has changed. We\\'re going to start with you, Senator Kerry, because you made three speeches in New Hampshire in which, to a lot of people in the South, it appears that you were kissing off this region, until your friend Senator Fritz Hollings got to you, and then you began to sing more warmly about the South. (LAUGHTER) On the other hand, I ran into a man last night, a Republican who\\'s not happy with George Bush, but when I raised you name he said, \"Big liberal from Massachusetts. \" How can you come South, given what you said about the Democrats making a mistake in spending too much time worry about the South. . . . : . . . and expect to do well here. . : Thank you, John Kerry. Senator Edwards, you\\'ve got a lot at stake here. Is this a do-  or- die race for you? . : But if you don\\'t win, do you go forward from here? . : Governor Dean, you have made a big change in your campaign this week. You fired the man who brought you to this dance. . : You brought in somebody from Washington D. C. who was in the Clinton White House, promised he wouldn\\'t go to work as a lobbyist, then immediately went to work as a lobbyist. He is a quintessential Washington insider, admired by a lot of people in the party. But doesn\\'t that change the whole DNA of the Howard Dean campaign? . : Now a telecommunications lobbyist. . : I want to get out of the horse- race business and into the substance of this campaign in just a moment. But let me ask you, General Clark, and Senator Lieberman, and Congressman Kucinich, and Reverend Sharpton, the party chairman Terry McAuliffe says if one of you guys doesn\\'t win one of these primaries in the next week, let\\'s make it the next two weeks, in which there are a lot of primaries, you ought to think about getting out of the race. If any of you don\\'t come in first in any of these many primaries coming up in the next two weeks, will you get out of the race? . : And Congressman - -  Senator Lieberman, if you don\\'t win one of these races, will you get out of the race? Now, I know you\\'re going to take that as an opportunity to make the same kind of. . . . : . . . that the general just did. . : But it\\'s a legitimate question for the people of this country, and especially for the people of your party. . : I\\'m going to ask the audience one more time to just - -  I know that it\\'s a partisan group, but - -  so that we can move right along. . : And Reverend Sharpton? . : Reverend Al, thanks very much. Governor Dean, you said, appropriately enough, that you really did bring Iraq into this campaign in a very dramatic fashion. All this week, we\\'ve been hearing from David Kay, who was the chief U. S. weapons inspector in Iraq, saying that the intelligence was almost all wrong. He\\'s now called for an independent commission to investigate what in fact went wrong. And at a hearing before the Armed Services Committee the other day, Senator Edward Kennedy said there was a deliberate manipulation of the intelligence. You said that the books were cooked. Cooking the books means that there was a fraud of some kind, in an attempt to achieve something that wasn\\'t in fact true. David Kay has said that that wasn\\'t the case. He thinks the president was just simply abused by the intelligence agencies. . : But in fairness, David Kay also told me the other day that he thinks now, looking back, that the two years before we went to war was the most dangerous period in Iraq in a long, long time because it was spinning out of control. Saddam Hussein was not in charge. There were people coming in and going out of the country, including well- known terrorists. You saw the defense - -  you saw the National Intelligence Estimate, Senator Edwards, as a member of the Intelligence Committee. Did you believe it when you saw it? And was that the basis for your vote, which you enthusiastically talked about when you made the vote to authorize war against Iraq? . : Senator Kerry, Governor Dean has made a very serious charge against the vice president, saying that he went to the CIA. We know that he did that, but do you believe that he berated middle- level people at the intelligence agency to, in effect, shape the intelligence that he wanted? . : Senator Lieberman, do you think that Libya would have given up its weapons of mass destruction if the United States had not invaded Iraq? . : General Clark, your friend, Congressman Kucinich, would pull the United States troops out of Iraq right away and go to the U. N. and say, \"You go in and take over the peacekeeping there. \" Would you tell him about what happened when we had U. N. peacekeepers in Bosnia? . : Well, tell me what you would do. . : I shortcut several of the steps that you would make, but nonetheless, you would turn over the security eventually to U. N. peacekeepers. . : Reverend Sharpton? . : On that note, we\\'ll say that we\\'re going to continue this discussion, talking about the United States, the West for that matter, and its relationship with the nation of Islam, the war on terror, and especially here in South Carolina, what happened to all the jobs and how can they be replaced? . : We\\'re back on stage at the Peace Center for Performing Arts in Greenville, South Carolina, with the seven presidential candidates contesting for the Democratic presidential nomination. South Carolina\\'s primary is next Tuesday. Senator Kerry, let me ask you a question. Robert Kagan, who writes about these issues a great deal from the Carnegie Institute for Peace, has written recently that Europeans believe that the Bush administration has exaggerated the threat of terrorism, and the Bush administration believes that the Europeans simply don\\'t get it. Who is right? . : Where has the exaggeration been in the threat on terrorism? . : General Clark, you\\'ve been quite outspoken in blaming the Bush administration for the terrorist attacks of 9/11. You better. . . . : That\\'s the premise of my question. The fact of the matter is that I said I think that you know better than anyone is that we were under attack in this country by Osama bin Laden well before George Bush took office: the original attack on the World Trade Center, the attack on the USS Cole in the Arabian Sea, the attack on the U. S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, which happened during the Clinton administration. Was there an inadequate response to terrorism during President Clinton\\'s term? . : You don\\'t have to be on the inside. We know what happened. . : I dislike telling a general that he has to stop, but you have to stop right there. Congressman Kucinich, you were serving in the House of Representatives during the Clinton administration. You weren\\'t raising your hand and say, \"Hey, wait a minute. We\\'re being attacked in our embassies; our ships are being attacked. Khobar Towers was attacked in Saudi Arabia. What are we doing about that? \" You\\'ve often been an early alert system for a lot of urgent issues in this country, but it simply wasn\\'t on the agenda, was it, in the Congress, as well, during the previous administration? . : Senator Lieberman, the president said the other night in the State of the Union address, \"I don\\'t need a permission slip from the United Nations to defend the natural security interests of this country. \" Isn\\'t that a legitimate position for a president of the United States? . : Reverend Sharpton, there is a great war going on in the world between the West and the Nation of Islam. And the United States, at the moment, is losing the war for hearts and minds. Everyone agrees on that, whatever their political position happens to be. Specifically, what should the United States be doing in terms of programs? And how much money should it commit to find common ground between this country and the democratic ideals that we all embrace and the Nation of Islam? . : I\\'m talking about Islamic nations. . : No, no, I\\'m talking about the Islamic movement around the world, because it really does transcend nations in many ways. . : You said that President Bush said. . : Not the president himself? . : We\\'re now one- for- one here. . : Senator Edwards, do you think they would get enough help from our so- called Arab allies in this fight that is going on between those members of the Islamic movement who believe that we\\'re unworthy and heathens in this country, and what the Bush administration is trying to do to close that schism that exists in too many areas? . : Before we end this segment, Governor Dean, let me ask you, there is an attempt now on the part of Republicans, as well as Democrats, to modify the Patriot Act. There\\'s something called SAFE that a lot of Republicans have signed on to. Today, the attorney general warned that it would prohibit, or at least restrict his ability to wiretap terrorist suspects. And he said, if it\\'s passed, this president will veto it. . : When we come back in just a moment, we\\'re going to talk about the issue here in the state of South Carolina, the loss of jobs in the last three years and what happens to the future of this economy. All that and more when we come back from Greenville here on MSNBC in a moment. . : We\\'re back in Greenville, South Carolina, with the seven Democratic candidates for the presidential nomination of their party. And in this state, there is no bigger issue than the issue of jobs. South Carolina\\'s lost more jobs than at any time since the Great Depression - -  28,000 in the textile industry alone in the past three years or so. Governor Dean, wherever I go, you ask people, \"Why did that happen? \" they\\'ll say, \"NAFTA, it\\'s all about NAFTA. \" They\\'re moving offshore because these foreign countries and foreign companies have a much better deal. You were endorsed by former Vice President Al Gore. No one played a larger role in getting NAFTA passed and pushed through than the man who endorsed you, Vice President Gore. . : Senator Lieberman, NAFTA has become the bogeyman of this campaign, especially among Democrats. It was passed by your party. . : Was it a mistake? . : Congressman Kucinich, I know you have some strong feelings about NAFTA, but let me just preface your remarks with this observation. This material that\\'s coming in now from foreign countries - -  it\\'s a tragedy to lose the jobs here in South Carolina, but if you go to Illinois or California or the Great Plains and people go to Walmart or Costco or any of the other big, big stores these days, they kind of like those prices. They\\'ve gotten used to the idea of not paying as much for shoes or shirts or clothing or any other number of items because they are manufactured offshore. . : Congressman, thank you very much. Senator Kerry, can you look the good people of South Carolina in the eye and say, \"If you elect me president, we\\'ll turn back the clock. You\\'re going to get all of those textile manufacturing jobs back. We\\'re going to change the equation in this country, and they won\\'t be producing the goods in Malaysia or in China or in Mexico if I\\'m the president of the United States\"? But here\\'s what I can say to them: I will be a president who\\'s on the side of workers in this country to provide the American worker with a fair playing field, to provide the American worker with a fair shot to be able to compete. Because that\\'s not what they have today. They have a president who\\'s selling their jobs out to large corporations, whether it\\'s the drug companies or the oil industry, who\\'s not fighting for real people and the lives they lead on a daily basis. I was at Midlands Community College today. Fritz Hollings helped create as governor a network of community colleges that are technical, that help train people. This administration is backing off that kind of technical training. They turned around and gave $120 million of technical training, when they cut a billion dollars over the course of the last few years. That\\'s like kicking down the barn door and saying, \"Here are some twigs. Rebuild it. \" We need a president who\\'s going to fight for trade that\\'s fair. We need a president who\\'s going to close the loopholes of these corporations that have a reward, Tom, to take the jobs overseas. I\\'m going to go to the tax code that\\'s gone from 14 pages to 17,000 pages, and we\\'re going to take out any benefit, any reward, any incentive, for any Benedict Arnold company or CEO to take American jobs overseas and stick the American people with the bill. And that\\'s what we need to do. . : Senator Edwards, is it realistic to talk to the American people about stopping the global economy and the movement toward it, of manufacturing overseas a lot of these piece goods and other products that were manufactured here for many years, and it\\'s not going to come back? . : Let ask General Wesley Clark about a development in Washington today. The White House announced that - -  whoops - -  the new Medicare prescription drug bill is going to cost a third more than they originally said. And the deficit this next year is going to be more than $500 billion more than. The CBO office says that, in fact, in the next 10 years, that this prescription drug Medicare benefit bill could cost as much as a trillion dollars. If you were the president of the United States, would you tear it up and start all over again? . : But let\\'s start with this one. . : Reverend Sharpton, should wealthy Americans or people who are well off, for that matter, pay more for their Medicare benefits? Should we begin now a real test of means and apply it to the Medicare costs that are beginning to run exponentially out of control? . : Senator Kerry, the last time that we met, or at least I was involved in one of these debates, you were very tough on Governor Dean, challenging him to come out against cutting back on the growth rate of Medicare. Aren\\'t today\\'s numbers one more demonstration that we\\'re going to have to do something about the rate of growth in these entitlement programs, or my grandchildren and yours are going to carry a very, very heavy burden in the future? . : We want to continue this discussion about entitlements and what they\\'re costing the society and talk about health care as well. We\\'ll be back from Greenville, South Carolina, in just a moment. . : We\\'re back at the Peace Center for Performing Arts in Greenville, South Carolina. The South Carolina primary and six others are next Tuesday. And we have been talking about the cost of entitlements in this country, Social Security and Medicare and all the other entitlement programs, as well as health care. We\\'re going to continue that conversation now. During the break, Governor Dean said to me that this is so mellow. Well, Governor, we\\'re in the South, where there\\'s premium on politeness. . . (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) . . . so I\\'m going to invite you to stir it up here a little bit, if you\\'d like to. We were talking just a few moments ago about the Medicare prescription drug benefits bill. Just let me read to you a couple of numbers that the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has come out with. Well beyond the next 10 years, which is the projection now going on, they believe that it could cost up to $1. 2 trillion in the second 10 years. It could be as much as $190 billion in the year 2023 alone. You don\\'t have to be a math wiz to know that that will break this country and break the spirit of the generation coming along. You disagree? . : Senator, I think you deserve a response to that. . : Senator, we\\'re in the rebuttal rule that we\\'re in right now, so you ran over a little bit. We\\'ll come back to that in just a few minutes. Dennis Kucinich, you\\'re the only member of this panel, I think - -  maybe the Reverend Sharpton has come out - -  for a single- payer health care system. . : Why do you think there\\'s so much resistance on the part of your colleagues on this stage to going to something like a single-  payer system? Is it the Hillary factor? . : Senator? . : Let me just ask you very quickly, Senator, why didn\\'t that happen in the Clinton administration? There you had the White House and you had Democratic majorities going on, and it didn\\'t get done. . : Senator Edwards, I was in an emergency room the other day with a doctor who got driven out of his private practice by all of the new rules and regulations of HMOs and so on, very dedicated ER doc. And I said to him in the course of the documentary that we\\'re doing about this great, great national debate over health care, I said, \"How much do you worry about medical malpractice here? \" He said, \"Well, I work 12 hours a day. I worry about it 11- and- a- half hours a day. \" (LAUGHTER) The president has said we ought to put a cap of some kind on medical malpractice awards. Now, you were a trial lawyer. You were involved in this kind of work. Shouldn\\'t there be some kind of modification, some kind of new system so that physicians can afford malpractice insurance and don\\'t practice what they call all- day- long defensive medicine, ordering up extra batteries of test at great cost because they\\'re worried about a lawyer around the corner? . : Reverend Sharpton, as you read the health care plans of your colleagues on the panel, with the exception of Congressman Kucinich who has a rather straightforward single- payer plan, do you think that they are the answer? Or are they too complicated? Are there too many parts to them? What\\'s your judgment about these health care plans that have been put forward in the course of this campaign? . : If you became president of the United States, General Clark, would you seriously examine a single- payer system that would allow people to opt out of it if they have the kind of money that would permit them to do that and buy private insurance plans? . : General Clark, thank you very much. When we come back in a moment, we\\'re going to talk about some of the other issues that are before this country. The president made it pretty clear the other night in his State of the Union speech that he sees this campaign about cultural issues as much as anything else. We\\'ll talk about some of that from here in Greenville, South Carolina, and much more, in just a moment here on MSNBC. . : We\\'re back in Greenville, South Carolina. We want to deal with a number of issues now in the final moments that we have here tonight. Senator Edwards, you say that the president is not moving this country forward on the issue of gay rights, and yet, you\\'re opposed to gay marriages and you say that, in your home state of North Carolina, you do not believe that they should have to recognize a gay marriage that takes place, for example, in Canada, or one that may, in the future, take place in Massachusetts. How is that moving the country forward on gay rights? . : Another big issue in the South, obviously, as it is the Midwest, and the West, the place of guns in American life. Governor Dean, what\\'s the value to this country of the NRA, in your judgment? . : You get 30 seconds for rebuttal here, Senator. . : Senator Kerry, thank you very much. General Clark, faith is a big component in South Carolina, and throughout the South, for that matter. There\\'s been a big, big dispute down here about the display of the Ten Commandments on public property. Should there be, in your judgment, some kind of a compromise so people who believe in the Ten Commandments, or people of the Jewish faith who want to put something out there that reflects their faith, or the Islamic faith, on public property have the right to do that? . : Speaking of public displays in the state of South Carolina, you\\'re not going to spend the night here because the NAACP has a boycott on against South Carolina, given the display of the Confederate flag. Could the Confederate flag be a part of the culture without being a part of the public life here, that people could take pride in their ancestry, in your judgment, under any circumstances? (APPLAUSE) I want to state this: That this country needs to do a whole lot of healing. We have to heal this country about 9/11; we have to heal this country about slavery; we have to heal this country about the Civil War. . . (APPLAUSE) . . . we have to heal this country about the dispossession of lands by Native Americans. (APPLAUSE) And my presidency will be to take these hands and to put them on the country to help heal America. Because all these divisions that have arisen in this country, when you play on them, it just exacerbates it. We need to remember the first motto of this country: \"Out of many, we are one. \" And I intend to help heal this country and bring it together, Tom. (APPLAUSE) . : Reverend Sharpton, is there any place for the Confederate flag, publicly or privately, in American life in 2004? . : Senator Kerry, final answer. Back in the 1990s, you expressed some reservations about affirmative action as it\\'s currently constituted. You said that it represented a culture of dependency and that we have to reexamine that. If you became president of the United States, would you attempt to put some kind of a sunset law on affirmative action, in which it would phase out after a number of years? . : Senator Kerry, thank you very much. And to all of you, our great thanks on behalf of the American people and MSNBC and, of course, the good people here of Greenville, South Carolina. Thank you all very much for being with us tonight.

Does the Iraq experience make it more likely or less likely that you would take the United States into another preemptive military action? . Mr. Lehrer. Senator Kerry, 90 seconds. . Mr. Lehrer. Thirty seconds. . Mr. Lehrer. Thirty seconds, Senator. . Mr. Lehrer. New question, 2 minutes, . Mr. Lehrer. Ninety seconds. . Mr. Lehrer. New question. Mr. President, do you believe that diplomacy and sanctions can resolve the nuclear problems with North Korea and Iran? Taking them in any order you would like. . Mr. Lehrer. Senator Kerry, 90 seconds. . Mr. Lehrer. I want to make sureâ€”yes, sirâ€”but in this one minute, I want to make sure that we understandâ€”the peopleâ€”the people watching you understand the differences between the two of you on this. You want to continue the multinational talks, correct? . Mr. Lehrer. And you wantâ€”you\\'re wanting to do itâ€”â€” . Mr. Lehrer. And you\\'re opposed to that, right? . Mr. Lehrer. New question, 2 minutes, . Mr. Lehrer. Ninety seconds. . Mr. Lehrer. New question, . Mr. Lehrer. Ninety- second response, Senator. . Mr. Lehrer. Thirty seconds. . Mr. Lehrer. Thirty seconds. . Mr. Lehrer. New question, 2 minutes, . Mr. Lehrer. Ninety seconds, Mr. President. . Mr. Lehrer. Just for this one- minute discussion here, is it justâ€”for whatever seconds it takesâ€”so it\\'s correct to say that if somebody is listening to this, that both of you agreeâ€”if you\\'re reelected, Mr. President, and if you are electedâ€”the single most serious threat you believeâ€”both of you believe is nuclear proliferation? . Mr. Lehrer. Your response to that. . Mr. Lehrer. All right, Mr. President, this isâ€”this is the last question, and 2 minutes. It\\'s a newâ€”new subject, new question. And it has to do with President Putin and Russia. Did you misjudge him, or are youâ€” do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is okay? . Mr. Lehrer. Ninety seconds, . Mr. Lehrer. Thirty seconds, Mr. President. . Mr. Lehrer. Right. Well, but whatâ€”he used the word \"truth\" again. . Mr. Lehrer. Talking about the truth of the matter. He used the word \"truth\" again. Did that raise any hackles that youâ€” with you? . Mr. Lehrer. All right. Yes. . Mr. Lehrer. All right, that brings us to closing statements. And again, as determined by a coin toss, Senator Kerry, you go first, and you have 2 minutes. . Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President, 2 minutes. . Mr. Lehrer. And that ends tonight\\'s debate. A reminder, the second Presidential debate will be a week from tomorrow, October 8th, from Washington University in St. Louis. Charles Gibson of ABC News will moderate a townhall- type event. Then, on October 13th, from Arizona State University in Tempe, Bob Schieffer of CBS News will moderate an exchange on domestic policy that will be similar in format to tonight\\'s. Also, this coming Tuesday, at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, the Vice Presidential candidates, Vice President Cheney and Senator Edwards, will debate with my PBS colleague, Gwen Ifill, moderating. For now, thank you, Senator Kerry, .', 'SCHIEFFER': \" Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, you have 90 seconds. . Mr. Schieffer. Anything to add, Senator Kerry? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. New question, Mr. President, to you. We're talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year. Suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen? . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, would you like to add something? . Mr. Schieffer. Time is up. . Mr. Schieffer. All right, Senator Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. My question is, how can you or any President, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Let's go to a new question, Mr. President, 2 minutes. And let's continue on jobs. You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual. Mr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who is being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States? . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. New question to you, Senator Kerry, 2 minutes, and it's still on jobs. You know, many experts say that a President really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the President's fault. So I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here. Both of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question. Do you believe homosexuality is a choice? . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. Senator Kerry, a new question for you. The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem cell research. What is your reaction to that? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, let's have a new question. It goes to you, and let's get back to economic issues. Health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last 4 years, according to the Washington Post. We're paying more; we're getting less. I would like to ask you, who bears responsibility for this? Is it the Government? Is it the insurance companies? Is it the lawyers? Is it the doctors? Is it the administration? . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. Go ahead, Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. . Mr. Schieffer. Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, let's stay on health care. You have, as you have proposed and as the President has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health care coverage to children. You're also talking about the Government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the President's tax cut on the upper two percent. . Mr. Schieffer. You heard the President say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that. I just ask you, where are you going to get the money? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Senator. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, the next question is to you. We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed. You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding a trillion dollars over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. So where do you get the money? Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years? . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits. Alan Green- span, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, says there's no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate. What he's suggesting, we're going to have to cut benefits or we're going to have to raise retirement age; we may have to take some other reform. But if you've just said you've promised no changes, does that mean you're just going to leave this as a problem, another problem, for our children to solve? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. I got more e- mail this week on this question than any other question, and it is about immigration. I'm told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know. Some believe it's an economic issue. Some see it as a human rights issue. How do you see it, and what do we need to do about it? . Mr. Schieffer. Time's up. Senator. . Mr. Schieffer. Do you want to respond, Mr. President? . Mr. Schieffer. Senator. . Mr. Schieffer. Next question to you, . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, I want to go back to something Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a followup of my own. He saidâ€”and this will be a new question to youâ€”he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. So I'd ask you directly, would you like to? . Mr. Schieffer. Senator Kerry, you'd like to respond? . Mr. Schieffer. That's a new question for . Mr. Schieffer. You have 90 seconds. . Mr. Schieffer. Yes, sir. . Mr. Schieffer. Senator. . Mr. Schieffer. All right, let's go to another question, and it is to . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Senator. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, new question, 2 minutes. You said that if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that you'd sign the legislation. But you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it. Why not? . Mr. Schieffer. Senator. . Mr. Schieffer. Let's go to a new question. For you, Senator Kerry, 2 minutes. Affirmative actionâ€”do you see a need for affirmative action programs, or have we moved far enough along that we no longer need to use race and gender as a factor in school admissions and Federal and State contracts, and so on? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President, let's go to a new question. You were asked before the invasionâ€”or after the invasion of Iraq if you had checked with your dad. And I believeâ€”I don't remember the quote exactlyâ€”but I believe you said you had checked with a higher authority. I would like to ask you, what part does your faith play on your policy decisions? . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. Senator Kerry, after 9/11â€” and this is a new question for youâ€”it seemed to me that the country came together as I've never seen it come together since World War II. But some of that seems to have melted away. I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. But if you were elected President or whoever is elected President, will you set a priority in trying to bring the Nation back together? Or what would be your attitude on that? . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. We've come, gentlemen, to our last question. And it occurred to me, as I came to this debate tonight, that the three of us share something. All three of us are surrounded by very strong women. We're all married to strong women. Each of us have two daughters that make us very proud. I'd like to ask each of you, what is the most important thing you've learned from these strong women? . Mr. Schieffer. . Mr. Schieffer. Well, gentlemen, that brings us to the closing statements. Senator Kerry, I believe you're first. . Mr. Schieffer. Mr. President. . Mr. Schieffer. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, .\", 'CHENEY': ' : Gwen, I want to thank you, and I want to thank the folks here at Case Western Reserve for hosting this tonight. It\\'s a very important event, and they\\'ve done a superb job of putting it together. It\\'s important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists where ever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director\\'s testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10- year relationship. The effort that we\\'ve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing. . : We\\'ve made significant progress in Iraq. We\\'ve stood up a new government that\\'s been in power now only 90 days. The notion of additional troops is talked about frequently, but the point of success in Iraq will be reached when we have turned governance over to the Iraqi people; they have been able to establish a democratic government. They\\'re well on their way to doing that. They will have free elections next January for the first time in history. We also are actively, rapidly training Iraqis to take on the security responsibility. Those two steps are crucial to success in Iraq. They\\'re well in hand, well under way. And I\\'m confident that, in fact, we\\'ll get the job done. . : The senator has got his facts wrong. I have not suggested there\\'s a connection between Iraq and 9/11, but there\\'s clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror. And the point is that that\\'s the place where you\\'re most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years. Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror. They\\'ve got a very limited view about how to use U. S. military forces to defend America. We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U. S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That\\'s part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U. N. approval. Then, in the mid- \\'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. It\\'s a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues. A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues. And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn\\'t again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida. . : Gwen, we\\'ve never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one. We\\'ve actively and aggressively pursued him. We\\'ve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan. We\\'ll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I\\'m confident eventually we\\'ll get him. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we\\'ve done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization. John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over. Here we are, two and a half years later, we\\'re four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan. We\\'ve got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women. That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. We\\'ve made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago. He just got it wrong. The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary. We\\'re standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security. We\\'ll keep U. S. forces there - -  we have about 16,000 there today - -  as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation. But they\\'re making significant progress. We have President Karzai, who is in power. They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever. Schools are open. Young girls are going to school. Women are going to vote. Women are even eligible to run for office. This is major, major progress. There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it. Freedom is the best antidote to terror. . : Twenty years ago we had a similar situation in El Salvador. We had - -  guerrilla insurgency controlled roughly a third of the country, 75,000 people dead, and we held free elections. I was there as an observer on behalf of the Congress. The human drive for freedom, the determination of these people to vote, was unbelievable. And the terrorists would come in and shoot up polling places; as soon as they left, the voters would come back and get in line and would not be denied the right to vote. And today El Salvador is a whale of a lot better because we held free elections. The power of that concept is enormous. And it will apply in Afghanistan, and it will apply as well in Iraq. . : Well, Gwen, the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong. When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they\\'ve taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U. S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent. With respect to the cost, it wasn\\'t $200 billion. You probably weren\\'t there to vote for that. But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq. The rest of it\\'s for Afghanistan and the global war on terror. The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate. That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we\\'ve got, but, you know, better than 40 percent. So your facts are just wrong, Senator. You also have a situation where you talk about credibility. It\\'s awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time. You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor. You\\'re not credible on Iraq because of the enormous inconsistencies that John Kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign. Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, that\\'s where you\\'re at. But you\\'ve not been consistent, and there\\'s no indication at all that John Kerry has the conviction to successfully carry through on the war on terror. . : Your rhetoric, Senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up. There isn\\'t. And you cannot use \"talk tough\" during the course of a 90- minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30- year record in the United States Senate and, prior to that by John Kerry, who has consistently come down on the wrong side of all the major defense issues that he\\'s faced as a public official. . : I\\'m saying specifically that I don\\'t believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief because I don\\'t think, based on his record, that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if we\\'re going to defeat these terrorists. We need to battle them overseas so we don\\'t have to battle them here at home. I\\'m not challenging John Kerry\\'s patriotism. I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that. We\\'ve never criticized his patriotism. What we\\'ve questioned is his judgment. And his judgment\\'s flawed, and the record\\'s there for anybody who wants to look at it. In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and \\'91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq. The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn\\'t display the qualities of somebody who has conviction. And with respect to this particular operation, we\\'ve seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed - -  body armor, spare parts, ammunition - -  they voted against it. I couldn\\'t figure out why that happened initially. And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti- war record. So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti- war vote and they voted against the troops. Now if they couldn\\'t stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida? . : Well, Gwen, I think the record speaks for itself. These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad. We have not seen the kind of consistency that a commander in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartime and in order to be able to see the strategy through to victory. If we want to win the war on terror, it seems to me it\\'s pretty clear the choice is George Bush, not John Kerry. . : Well, Gwen, it\\'s hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies there. The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn\\'t have what they have today if you guys had had your way. You talk about internationalizing the effort. They don\\'t have a plan. Basically, it\\'s an echo. You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in \\'91 was far stronger than this. No. We had 34 countries then; we\\'ve got 30 today. We\\'ve got troops beside us. It\\'s hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process. You end up with a situation in which - -  talk about demeaning. In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it\\'s the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops. Makes no sense at all. It\\'s totally inconsistent. There isn\\'t a plan there. Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi. He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House. And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility. That is not the way to win friends and allies. You\\'re never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude. . : Classic example. He won\\'t count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies. It\\'s their country. They\\'re in the fight. They\\'re increasingly the ones out there putting their necks on the line to take back their country from the terrorists and the old regime elements that are still left. They\\'re doing a superb job. And for you to demean their sacrifices strikes me as. . . . : . . . as beyond. . . . : It is indeed. You suggested. . . . : . . . somehow they shouldn\\'t count, because you want to be able to say that the Americans are taking 90 percent of the sacrifice. You cannot succeed in this effort if you\\'re not willing to recognize the enormous contribution the Iraqis are increasingly making to their own future. We\\'ll win when they take on responsibility for governance, which they\\'re doing, and when the take on responsibility for their own security, which they increasingly are doing. . : Gwen, the story that appeared today about this report is one I asked for. I ask an awful lot of questions as part of my job as vice president. A CIA spokesman was quoted in that story as saying they had not yet reached the bottom line and there is still debate over this question of the relationship between Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein. The report also points out that at one point some of Zarqawi\\'s people were arrested. Saddam personally intervened to have them released, supposedly at the request of ZarqawiBut let\\'s look at what we know about Mr. Zarqawi. We know he was running a terrorist camp, training terrorists in Afghanistan prior to 9/11. We know that when we went into Afghanistan that he then migrated to Baghdad. He set up shop in Baghdad, where he oversaw the poisons facility up at Kermal (ph), where the terrorists were developing ricin and other deadly substances to use. We know he\\'s still in Baghdad today. He is responsible for most of the major car bombings that have killed or maimed thousands of people. He\\'s the one you will see on the evening news beheading hostages. He is, without question, a bad guy. He is, without question, a terrorist. He was, in fact, in Baghdad before the war, and he\\'s in Baghdad now after the war. The fact of the matter is that this is exactly the kind of track record we\\'ve seen over the years. We have to deal with Zarqawi by taking him out, and that\\'s exactly what we\\'ll do. . : No, I do not. And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions. What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there\\'s a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don\\'t have any impact, except to penalize American companies. We\\'ve got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U. N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don\\'t live up to their obligations under the initial - -  International Atomic Energy Agency Non- Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U. N. Security Council. We\\'re working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who\\'ve been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow- up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran\\'s living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they aren\\'t, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U. N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. We\\'re addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by- products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A. Q. Khan, has been shut down. We\\'ve made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation. And we\\'ll continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well. . : I can respond, Gwen, but it\\'s going to take more than 30 seconds. . : Well, the reason they keep mentioning Halliburton is because they\\'re trying to throw up a smokescreen. They know the charges are false. They know that if you go, for example, to factcheck. com (sic), an independent Web site sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania, you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton. It\\'s an effort that they\\'ve made repeatedly to try to confuse the voters and to raise questions, but there\\'s no substance to the charges. . : Gwen, I want to go back to the last comment, and then I\\'ll come back to Israel- Palestine. The reason they keep trying to attack Halliburton is because they want to obscure their own record. And Senator, frankly, you have a record in the Senate that\\'s not very distinguished. You\\'ve missed 33 out of 36 meetings in the Judiciary Committee, almost 70 percent of the meetings of the Intelligence Committee. You\\'ve missed a lot of key votes: on tax policy, on energy, on Medicare reform. Your hometown newspaper has taken to calling you \"Senator Gone. \" You\\'ve got one of the worst attendance records in the United States Senate. Now, in my capacity as vice president, I am the president of Senate, the presiding officer. I\\'m up in the Senate most Tuesdays when they\\'re in session. The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight. In respect to Israel and Palestine, Gwen, the suicide bombers, in part, were generated by Saddam Hussein, who paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers. I personally think one of the reasons that we don\\'t have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we\\'ve had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business. We\\'ve been strong supporters of Israel. The president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states. First president ever to say we\\'ll establish and support a Palestinian state nextdoor to Israelis. But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with. And we won\\'t have that, we don\\'t have it now, in a Yasser Arafat. There has to be reform of the Palestinian system. . : Oh, I think his record speaks for itself. And frankly, it\\'s not very distinguished. . : I think it goes to Senator Edwards. . : I concede the point. (LAUGHTER). : Well, Gwen, there are several things that I think need to be done and are being done. We\\'ve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president\\'s already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There\\'s no better antidote to poverty than a good, well- paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we\\'ve got to deal effectively with tax policy. We\\'ve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We\\'ve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I\\'d zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first- class public school system. I\\'m a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education. It\\'s also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we\\'ve done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education. It\\'s working. We\\'ve seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students. We\\'re making significant progress. . : Gwen, we\\'ve got 111 million American taxpayers that have benefited from our income tax cuts. We\\'ve got 33 million students who\\'ve benefited from No Child Left Behind. We\\'ve got 40 million seniors who benefited from the reform of the Medicare system. The Democrats promised prescription drug benefits. For years they\\'ve run on that platform. They never got it done. The president got it done. We also dropped 5 million people totally off the federal income tax rolls, so they no longer have to pay any federal income tax at all. So the story, I think, is a good one. And the data he\\'s using is old data. It\\'s from 2003. It doesn\\'t include any of the gains that we\\'ve made in the last years. We\\'ve added 1. 7 million jobs to the economy. . : Gwen, the Kerry record on taxes is one basically of voting for a large number of tax increases - -  98 times in the United States Senate. There\\'s a fundamental philosophical difference here between the president and myself, who believe that we ought to let the American people keep more of what they earn and we ought to empower them to have more control over their own lives - -  I think the Kerry- Edwards approach basically is to raise taxes and to give government more control over the lives of individual citizens. We think that\\'s the wrong way to go. There\\'s a fundamental difference of opinion here. They talk about the top bracket and going after only those people in the top bracket. Well, the fact of the matter is a great many of our small businesses pay taxes under the personal income taxes rather than the corporate rate. And about 900,000 small businesses will be hit if you do, in fact, do what they want to do with the top bracket. That\\'s not smart because seven out of 10 new jobs in America are created by small businesses. You do not want to tax them. It\\'s a bad idea to increase the burden on those folks. The senator himself said, during the course of the primaries, that the Kerry plan would drive us deeper into deficit. Those were the senator\\'s word about his running- mate. The fact of the matter is, the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent. That\\'s good policy. That\\'s what we ought to do. But with fiscal restraint, we\\'ll also drive the deficit down 50 percent in the course of the next five years. . : Yesterday, the president signed an extension of middle-  class tax cuts, the 10 percent bracket, the marriage penalty relief and the increase in the child tax credit. Senators Kerry and Edwards weren\\'t even there to vote for it when it came to final passage. . : Gwen, you\\'re right, four years ago in this debate, the subject came up. And I said then and I believe today that freedom does mean freedom for everybody. People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want. It\\'s really no one else\\'s business. That\\'s a separate question from the issue of whether or not government should sanction or approve or give some sort of authorization, if you will, to these relationships. Traditionally, that\\'s been an issue for the states. States have regulated marriage, if you will. That would be my preference. In effect, what\\'s happened is that in recent months, especially in Massachusetts, but also in California, but in Massachusetts we had the Massachusetts Supreme Court direct the state of - -  the legislature of Massachusetts to modify their constitution to allow gay marriage. And the fact is that the president felt that it was important to make it clear that that\\'s the wrong way to go, as far as he\\'s concerned. Now, he sets the policy for this administration, and I support the president. . : Well, Gwen, let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter. I appreciate that very much. . : That\\'s it. . : Well, Gwen. . . . : First of all, I\\'m not familiar with his cases. My concern is specifically with what\\'s happened to our medical care system because of rising malpractice insurance rates, because we failed to adequately reform our medical liability structure. I was in New Mexico the other day and met with a group of OB/GYN docs. And they were deeply concerned because they were fearful that there\\'d be another increase in malpractice insurance rates as a result of what they believe are frivolous lawsuits and that that would put them out of business. And one doctor indicated that her rates have gone up so much that she\\'s now to the point where she is screening patients. She won\\'t take high- risk patients anymore because of the danger that that will generate a lawsuit, and a lawsuit will put her out of business. This has had a devastating impact in a lot of communities. My home state of Wyoming, we\\'ve lost the top insurer of malpractice insurance in the state. The rates for a general practitioner have gone from $40,000 a year to $100,000 a year for an insurance policy. We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care. As I say, high risk patients don\\'t get covered anymore. We\\'ve lost one out of eleven OB/GYN practitioners in the country. We think it can be fixed, needs to be fixed. Now, specifically, what we need to do is cap non- economic damages, and we also think you need to limit the awards that the trial attorneys take out of all of this. Over 50 percent of the settlements go to the attorneys and for administrating overhead. We passed medical liability reform through the House of Representatives. It\\'s been blocked in the Senate. Senator Kerry\\'s voted 10 times against medical liability reform, and I don\\'t believe Senator Edwards supports it, either, not the kind that would be meaningful. . : Gwen, we think lawsuit abuse is a serious problem in this country. We think we badly need tort reform. I was in Minnesota the other day, where I visited an aircraft manufacturing plant. It\\'s a great success story. This is a company that started 20 years ago with nothing. Today they\\'re the second-  leading producer of piston- driven aircraft in the country. He told me that if it weren\\'t for the increased cost of his liability insurance, in this case product liability, he could hire 200 more people in his factory. We\\'ve built into the system enormous costs as a result of our practice with respect to litigation. We have to find ways to get a handle on it. He mentioned Medicare up 17 percent, somehow that that was something we caused. No. The 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums was the direct result of a statute adopted in 1997. John Kerry voted for it. It establishes the formula for Part B of Medicare that says, in effect, it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program. And the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those eligible for benefits. While you were in private practice in law and as a senator, you had the advantage of a special tax loophole, Subchapter S corporation, which you set up so you could avoid paying $600,000 in Medicare taxes that would have gone into the fund. And it\\'s those kinds of loopholes that necessitate a premium increase under the law that was enacted in 1997, supported by John Kerry. . : We\\'ve done a lot to reduce the cost of health care. The Medicare drug benefit that we\\'ll be providing to seniors beginning in \\'06 will provide upwards to $1,300 a year to help them buy prescription drugs. The drug savings - -  drug discount card that\\'s now available saves an estimated 15 percent to 30 percent off the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens. So we\\'re moving in as many areas as we can to make certain we hold down and reduce the health care costs. . : Well, this is a great tragedy, Gwen, when you think about the enormous cost here in the United States and around the world of the AIDS epidemic - -  pandemic, really. Millions of lives lost, millions more infected and facing a very bleak future. In some parts of the world, we\\'ve got the entire, sort of, productive generation has been eliminated as a result of AIDS, all except for old folks and kids - -  nobody to do the basic work that runs an economy. The president has been deeply concerned about it. He has moved and proposed and gotten through the Congress authorization for $15 billion to help in the international effort, to be targeted in those places where we need to do everything we can, through a combination of education as well as providing the kinds of medicines that will help people control the infection. Here in the United States, we\\'ve made significant progress. I have not heard those numbers with respect to African-  American women. I was not aware that it was - -  that they\\'re in epidemic there, because we have made progress in terms of the overall rate of AIDS infection, and I think primarily through a combination of education and public awareness as well as the development, as a result of research, of drugs that allow people to live longer lives even though they are infected - -  obviously we need to do more of that. . : You want me to answer a question about his qualifications? . : I see. Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president. Different presidents approach it in different ways. When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasn\\'t because he was worried about carrying Wyoming. We got 70 percent of the vote in Wyoming, although those three electoral votes turned out to be pretty important last time around. What he said he wanted me to do was to sign on because of my experience to be a member of the team, to help him govern, and that\\'s exactly the way he\\'s used me. And I think from the perspective of the nation, it\\'s worked in our relationship, in this administration. I think it\\'s worked in part because I made it clear that I don\\'t have any further political aspirations myself. And I think that\\'s been an advantage. I think it allows the president to know that my only agenda is his agenda. I\\'m not worried about what some precinct committeemen in Iowa were thinking of me with respect to the next round of caucuses of 2008. It\\'s a very significant responsibility when you consider that at a moment\\'s notice you may have to take over as president of the United States and make all of those decisions. It\\'s happened several times in our history. And I think that probably is the most important consideration in picking a vice president, somebody who could take over. . : Well, I clearly believe that George W. Bush would be a better commander in chief. He\\'s already done it for four years. And he\\'s demonstrated, without question, the conviction, the vision, the determination to win this war against terror. He understands it\\'s a global conflict that reaches from the United States all the way around the globe to Jakarta. And those very special qualities are vital in a commander in chief. And I think the president has them, and I\\'m not at all convinced his opponent does. . : Why I am different from John Edwards. Well, in some respects, I think, probably there are more similarities than there are differences in our personal story. I don\\'t talk about myself very much, but I\\'ve heard Senator Edwards, and as I listen to him, I find some similarities. I come from relatively modest circumstances. My grandfather never even went to high school. I\\'m the first in my family to graduate from college. I carried a ticket in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for six years. I\\'ve been laid off, been hospitalized without health insurance. So I have some idea of the problems that people encounter. So I think the personal stories are, in some respects, surprisingly similar. With respect to how we\\'ve spent our careers, I obviously made a choice for public service. And I\\'ve been at it for a good long time now, except for those periods when we lost elections. And that goes with the turf, as well, too. I\\'m absolutely convinced that the threat we face now, the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real and that we have to use extraordinary measures to deal with it. I feel very strongly that the significance of 9/11 cannot be underestimated. It forces us to think in new ways about strategy, about national security, about how we structure our forces and about how we use U. S. military power. Some people say we should wait until we are attacked before we use force. I would argue we\\'ve already been attacked. We lost more people on 9/11 than we lost at Pearl Harbor. And I\\'m a very strong advocate of a very aggressive policy of going after the terrorists and those who support terror. . : No. . : Well, Gwen, I can think of a lot of words to describe Senator Kerry\\'s position on Iraq; \"consistent\" is not one of them. I think if you look at the record from voting for sending the troops then voting against the resources they needed when they got there, then saying I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it, saying in response to a question knowing everything I know now, yes, I would have cast exactly the same vote and then shortly after that saying wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, consistency doesn\\'t come to mind as I consider that record. The question of troops is an interesting and important one. We have looked to our commanders on the ground in Iraq for guidance on what they think they need. If they need more troops, they\\'ll ask us. But the key here is not to try to solve the problems in Iraq by putting in more American troops. The key is to get the Iraqis to take on the responsibility for their own security. That\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing. If you put American troops in there in larger number and don\\'t get the Iraqis into the fight, you\\'ll postpone the day when you can in fact bring our boys home. It\\'s vital that we deal with any need for additional troops by putting Iraqis into the effort. Forty- nine percent increase in funding for elementary and secondary education under No Child Left Behind; that\\'s a lot of money even by Massachusetts\\' standards. . : Gwen, No Child Left Behind, they were for it; now they\\'re against it. They voted for it; now they\\'re opposed to it. We are making significant progress there. We are closing the achievement gap. The results coming in from a number of studies show, without question, that on math and reading, that in fact our minority students, our Hispanic and African- American students are doing better, and that gap between them and the majority population is, in fact, closing. So we are doing exactly the right thing. They\\'re the ones who have been for the Patriot Act and against it, for No Child Left Behind and then against it. . : Well, I must say it\\'s one of the disappointments of the last four years, is that we\\'ve not been able to do what the president did in Texas, for example, when he was able to reach across the aisle and bring Democrats along on major issues of the day. We had some success early on, I think, in No Child Left Behind, when we, in fact, had broad, bipartisan support. We had a lot of support for the Patriot Act, when we passed that on a bipartisan basis. Now we\\'re seeing objection to that by the other side. All I know is to continue to try to work it. It\\'s a disappointment, in a sense, that I remember from my earlier service when things worked much differently, when, in fact, some of my best friends in the Congress were people I worked with, like Tom Foley, who was a majority leader and later speaker of the House. One of my strongest allies in Congress when I secretary of defense was Jack Murtha, a Democrat who is chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We used to be able to do more together on a bipartisan basis than seems possible these days. I\\'m not sure exactly why. I think, in part, it may be the change in the majority- minority status in the Senate has been difficult for both sides to adjust to. And the Senate, of course, has been very evenly divided, 50- 50, then 51- 49, then 49- 51 the other way. We\\'ll keep working at it. I think it\\'s important for us to try. I believe that it is essential for us to do everything we can to garner as much support from the other side of the aisle as possible. We\\'ve had support - -  we had our keynote address at our convention was delivered by Zell Miller. So there are some Democrats who agree with our approach. And hopefully in a second term, we\\'ll see an improvement along those lines. . : Well, Gwen - -  I\\'m sorry, it\\'s hard to know where to start. The fact of the matter is, the most important and significant change in health care in the last several years was the Medicare reform bill this year. It\\'s the most sweeping change in 40 years. Medicare used to pay for heart bypass surgery but didn\\'t pay for the prescription drugs that might allow you to avoid it. The fact is that when that came up, Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards voted against it. It\\'ll provide prescription drug benefits to 40 million senior citizens. It\\'s a very, very significant piece of legislation. . : Gwen, I want to thank you. It\\'s been a privilege to serve as your vice president these last four years and to work alongside President Bush to put our economy on an upward path. We\\'ve cut taxes, added 1. 7 million new jobs in the last year, and we\\'ll continue to provide opportunities for business and for workers. We won\\'t be happy until every American who wants to work can find a job. We believe that all Americans ought to have access to available - -  to medical care and that they ought to have access to the finest schools in the world. We\\'ll do everything we can to preserve Social Security and to make certain that it\\'s there for future generations. I\\'ve worked for four presidents and watched two others up close, and I know that there\\'s no such thing as a routine day in the Oval Office. We saw on 9/11 that the next president - -  next decision a president has to make can affect the lives of all of us. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a conflict unlike any we\\'ve ever known, faced with the possibility that terrorists could smuggle a deadly biological agent or a nuclear weapon into the middle of one of our own cities. That threat - -  and the presidential leadership needed to deal with it - -  is placing a special responsibility on all of you who will decide on November 2nd who will be our commander in chief. The only viable option for winning the war on terrorism is the one the president has chosen, to use the power of the United States to aggressively go after the terrorists wherever we find them and also to hold to account states that sponsor terror. Now that we\\'ve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, it\\'s important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that they\\'ll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons. This is the task of our generation. And I know firsthand the strength the president brings to it. The overall outcome will depend upon the ability of the American people and the strong leadership of the president to meet all the challenges that we\\'ll face in the days and years ahead. I\\'m confident we can do it. .'}\n"
